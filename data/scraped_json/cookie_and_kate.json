Transfer to a plate to cool.",

        "description": "This roasted salsa verde recipe is so easy to make. Just roast the tomatillos and pepper(s) and blend with a few basic ingredients for the best salsa verde you've ever tasted! Recipe yields about 2 1/2 cups salsa.",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 \u00bd pounds tomatillos (about 12 medium), husked and rinsed",
            "1 to 2 medium jalape\u00f1os, stemmed (omit for mild salsa, use 1 jalape\u00f1o for medium salsa and 2 jalape\u00f1os for hot salsa, note that spiciness will depend on heat of actual peppers used)",
            "\u00bd cup chopped white onion (about \u00bd medium onion)",
            "\u00bc cup packed fresh cilantro leaves (more if you love cilantro)",
            "2 tablespoons to \u00bc cup lime juice (1 to 2 medium limes, juiced), to taste",
            "\u00bd to 1 teaspoon salt, to taste",
            "Optional variation: 1 to 2 diced avocados, for creamy avocado salsa verde"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the broiler with a rack about 4 inches below the heat source. Place the tomatillos and jalape\u00f1o(s) on a rimmed baking sheet and broil until they\u2019re blackened in spots, about 5 minutes.",
            "Remove the baking sheet from the oven, carefully flip over the tomatillos and pepper(s) with tongs and broil for 4 to 6 more minutes, until the tomatillos are splotchy-black and blistered.",
            "Meanwhile, in a food processor or blender, combine the chopped onion, cilantro, 2 tablespoons lime juice and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Once the tomatillos are out of the oven, carefully transfer the hot tomatillos, pepper(s) and all of their juices into the food processor or blender.",
            "Pulse until the mixture is mostly smooth and no big chunks of tomatillo remain, scraping down the sides as necessary. Season to taste with additional lime juice and salt, if desired.",
            "The salsa will be thinner at first, but will thicken up after a few hours in the refrigerator, due to the naturally occurring pectin in the tomatillos. If you\u2019d like to make creamy avocado salsa verde, let the salsa cool down before blending in 1 to 2 diced avocados (the more avocado, the creamier it gets)."

        "description": "My family's favorite mashed potatoes recipe! These mashed potatoes are creamy, rich and tangy, thanks to the cream cheese and sour cream. You can make these mashed potatoes ahead of time, too (see the final step for details). Recipe yields 8 large or 12 medium servings; I believe you could successfully halve the recipe for a smaller crowd.",
        "ingredients": [
            "5 pounds Russet potatoes, preferably organic*",
            "3 teaspoons salt, divided",
            "6 ounces cream cheese (that\u2019s \u00be of one brick)",

            "To prepare your potatoes, you can either scrub them clean and leave them unpeeled (like I did) or rinse and peel them (for smooth, skin-free mashed potatoes). Then cut the potatoes into even chunks about 2\u201d in size (see photos).",
            "Place the potato chunks in a large Dutch oven or soup pot. Add 1 teaspoon of the salt, and enough water to cover the potatoes by 1 to 2 inches.",
            "Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Continue cooking, reducing the heat as necessary to prevent overflow, until the potatoes are easily pierced through by a fork, about 10 to 15 minutes.",
            "Carefully drain off all of the water and return the potatoes to the pot. Mash the potatoes until they reach your desired consistency (I like mine a little chunky, but you can mash them completely smooth if you prefer).",
            "Add the cream cheese, sour cream, butter, the remaining 2 teaspoons of salt and the onion powder. Stir until everything is mixed together evenly. You can serve the mashed potatoes immediately at this point, with garnishes of your choice.",
            "If you\u2019re making these mashed potatoes in advance, transfer them to a casserole dish with a lid (my Dutch oven is oven-safe so this was unnecessary). Smooth the top, cover, and store the mashed potatoes for up to 3 days in the refrigerator. To serve, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake the mashed potatoes, covered, until warmed through, about 30 to 35 minutes. Serve with garnishes of your choice."

Mix the mozzarella and Parmesan cheese together. Working in pairs, spread a generous layer of jam on one piece of bread and top the other with a generous handful of cheese, spread evenly down the bread (use a little more than you think you probably should). Top the cheese with a sprinkle of torn basil and press the other slice of bread, tomato jam-side down against the cheese to make a sandwich. Repeat for remaining sandwiches.",

Serve promptly, as the lettuce and croutons will soften with time."

            "To roast the sweet potatoes: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit with two racks placed near the middle of the oven, leaving a few inches in between the racks. Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent sticking.",

            "Bake until the sweet potatoes are tender and caramelized on the edges, about 30 to 35 minutes. Set aside, but leave the oven on for the crispy tortillas.",
            "Meanwhile, to cook the refried beans: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the garlic and cumin and cook, while stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.",
            "Add the drained beans, water and salt. Let the mixture come to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often, and reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Remove from the heat and mash the beans with a potato masher, pastry cutter or fork until the mixture is thick and spreadable. Cover and set aside.",
            "To prepare the crispy tortillas: On the remaining prepared baking sheet, brush both sides of each tortilla lightly with oil. Clear off the other baking sheet by transferring the roasted sweet potatoes to a serving bowl, but reuse the parchment paper. Arrange 4 tortillas in a single layer across each pan. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, turning halfway, until each tortilla is golden and lightly crisp. Set aside.",
            "To prepare the salad: In a medium serving bowl, combine the chopped lettuce, feta, about \u00bd cup of the red onion (reserve the rest for garnish), olive oil and lime juice. Toss to combine, and add a pinch of salt if the flavors don\u2019t quite sing yet. Divide the salad between 4 low, wide salad bowls or dinner plates.",
            "To assemble the tostadas, spread black beans over each tortilla, and place each one on a bed of salad. Top each tortilla with a few slices of avocado, followed by the sweet potatoes, and a sprinkle of red onion and cilantro. Serve with your favorite hot sauce or salsa on the side.",
            "Tostadas are best consumed promptly. If you have leftovers, store individual components separately, if possible. Leftover black beans make a good side, and they\u2019re also a great quesadilla filling."

For less spicy pickles, use a grapefruit spoon or small spoon to release the membranes where they attach to the inside of the pepper. Gently scoop or tap until the membranes and seeds fall out of the pepper, then discard those pieces. Slice the jalape\u00f1os into thin rounds with a mandoline or chef\u2019s knife.",
            "To test the spice level of your jalape\u00f1os, sample tiny bites from several peppers. If they\u2019re much too spicy, place the sliced jalapenos into a bowl and fill it with cool water. Let the jalapenos soak for 30 minutes, then drain them well. (You could even sample again at this point and soak for another 30 minutes if they\u2019re still terribly spicy.)",
            "Pour the vinegar, water, garlic (if using), and salt into a medium-sized glass jar. Stir to combine. Add the jalapenos to the jar, securely fasten the lid, and give the jar a gentle shake. It may seem like you don\u2019t have enough liquid, but the jalapenos sink over time.",
            "Refrigerate for at least 4 hours for fully pickled peppers. If you think of it during that time, give the peppers another gentle shimmy to help distribute them into the liquid. Pickled jalape\u00f1os will keep for up to 1 month in the refrigerator."

Sprinkle it lightly with salt, followed by a squeeze of lime juice (about 1 teaspoon). Massage the kale by scrunching it up in your hands, repeating until the kale is darker green and fragrant (this step softens the kale and makes it less bitter). You\u2019ll need 1 cup (packed) kale for the guacamole, so measure it out and set it aside.",

Taste, and add additional salt and/or lime juice, if necessary, and blend again (I usually add up to \u00bd teaspoon more salt and another tablespoon of lime juice). Serve immediately."

Combine the tahini and lemon juice in the bowl of your food processor (a smaller food processor will be better suited to the job) or high-powered blender (i.e. Vitamix or Blendtec). Process for about 1 \u00bd minutes, pausing to scrape down the bowl of your processor as necessary.",

Scrape down the bowl, then add the remaining chickpeas and process for until the hummus is thick and quite smooth, about 1 to 2 minutes more. If your hummus is too thick or hasn\u2019t yet blended into creamy oblivion, run the food processor while drizzling in 2 to 3 tablespoons water, until it reaches your desired consistency.",

            "2 pounds sweet potatoes (about 2 medium-large or 3 medium)",
            "1 tablespoon cornstarch",
            "\u00bd teaspoon fine sea salt",
            "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit with racks in the lower and upper thirds of the oven (make sure the top rack is about 6\u2033 from the heat source and no closer). Line two large, rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper so the fries don\u2019t get stuck to the pans.",
            "Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into fry-shaped pieces about \u00bc\u2033 wide and \u00bc\u2033 thick. Try to cut them into similarly sized pieces so the fries will bake evenly. Transfer half of the uncooked fries to one baking sheet, and the other half to the other baking sheet.",
            "Sprinkle the sweet potato fries with the cornstarch (use 1 \u00bd teaspoons per pan) and salt (\u00bc teaspoon per pan). Toss until the fries are lightly coated in powder. Drizzle the olive oil over the fries (1 tablespoon per pan) and toss until the fries are lightly and evenly coated in oil, and no powdery spots remain (use your fingers to rub visible cornstarch into the fries as necessary).",
            "Arrange your fries in a single layer and don\u2019t overcrowd; otherwise they will never crisp up. Bake for 20 minutes, then flip the fries so they can cook on all sides. (The easiest way to flip them is with a metal spatula. Section by section, scoop up about ten fries and flip them with a quick turn of the wrist.)",
            "Arrange the fries in even layers across the pans again, moving any particularly browned fries more toward the middle of the pan so they don\u2019t get overcooked. Return the pans to the oven, swapping their positions (former top pan goes to the lower rack and vice versa).",
            "Bake for 10 to 18 more minutes, or until the fries are crispy. You\u2019ll know they\u2019re almost done when the surface of the fries change from shiny orange to a more matte, puffed up texture. Keep an eye on them, as they can turn from crisp to burnt quickly. Sometimes the lower pan will be done a few minutes before the top pan. Don\u2019t worry if the edges are a little bit brown; they will taste more caramelized than burnt.",
            "If desired, toss the baked fries with seasonings, to taste. I like to use lots of freshly ground black pepper, and a scant \u00bc teaspoon each cayenne pepper and garlic powder. Serve warm!"

            "\u00bd pound jalape\u00f1os (choose larger jalape\u00f1os for less spicy pickles)",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "First, prepare your peppers: Wear gloves to prevent your fingers from feeling burned. For less spicy pickles, use a paring knife to remove the jalape\u00f1o membranes and seeds before slicing (this is a lot of work, so I just pulled out the larger membranes from my sliced pickles). Slice the pickles thin with a mandoline or chef\u2019s knife. If you\u2019re still concerned about the spice level of the pickles, run the sliced jalape\u00f1os under running water in a colander to try to knock off any remaining seeds. (Beware, those pepper fumes made me cough.) Slice off the top of the bell pepper and remove the seeds and membranes. Chop the bell pepper.",
            "Combine the prepared peppers and smashed garlic in a 28-ounce (1.75 pints) or larger glass jar. In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, honey and salt. Bring the mixture close to a boil on the stove, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sweetener into the liquid. Remove from heat and carefully pour the liquid over the peppers. Use a butter knife to poke down the peppers so they all fit and there aren\u2019t any hidden air pockets.",
            "Let the pickles cool to room temperature in the jar, then screw on a lid and refrigerate the pickles. Depending on how thinly you sliced the peppers, they could be ready to eat immediately or might need a couple of days in the refrigerator before they taste fully pickled (just sample one every now and then to find out!). They are best when relatively fresh, but keep well for at least a month."

Rinse the rice in a fine mesh colander under running water and set aside.",

Let the tofu rest for at least 10 minutes while you prep the Brussels sprouts.",

            "Transfer the pressed tofu to one of your prepared baking sheets and drizzle with the olive oil and tamari. Toss to combine. Sprinkle the arrowroot starch over the tofu, and toss the tofu until the starch is evenly coated, so there are no powdery spots remaining. Arrange the tofu in an even layer across the pan.",
            "To cook the rice: Once the water is boiling, add the rice. Let the rice boil for 30 minutes, then remove from heat and drain the rice. Transfer the drained rice back to the cooking pot and cover for 5 minutes. Remove lid, add a dash of sea salt and use a fork to fluff the rice. Set aside, partially covered, until you\u2019re ready to serve.",
            "To bake the sprouts and tofu: Transfer the pan of Brussels sprouts to the lower oven rack, and the pan of tofu to the top rack. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, tossing the contents of each pan halfway through cooking, until the sprouts and tofu are deeply golden on the edges.",
            "To make the glaze: In a small saucepan, whisk together the glaze ingredients (start with 1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce or sriracha and add more to taste). Bring the glaze to a gentle boil over medium heat, stirring often and reducing heat as necessary. Simmer until the glaze is reduced by about half (about 5 to 10 minutes; it\u2019s about done when it starts bubbling up substantially). Remove the glaze from the heat and set aside.",
            "To assemble: Divide the rice onto four plates. Top each plate with sprouts and tofu and drizzle with glaze. Finish each plate with a very generous sprinkling of sesame seeds and a small handful of chopped cilantro."

Press the dough into the tart pan evenly, using the heel of your hand to press the bottom smooth, which will help push the crust up the sides. Aim for even thickness across the bottom and up the edges (I didn\u2019t go quite far enough up the edges in my photos). Prick the base of the crust all over with a fork. (If the dough isn\u2019t cooperating, set the crust in the refrigerator for 10 minutes to firm it up before baking.)",
            "Bake the unfilled tart crust for 12 to 14 minutes, until it\u2019s firm to the touch and turning lightly golden at the edges. Place it on a cooling rack until cooled, about 30 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, to make the chocolate layer: Gently melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler or in the microwave in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring after every 30 second interval. Let the chocolate cool for 15 to 20 minutes, so that it\u2019s still warm enough to mix with the coconut cream, but not so warm that it melts the cream.",
            "To make the peanut butter whipped cream topping: Open one chilled can of coconut milk. You should see a thick, white layer of condensed coconut cream on top (if not, save the contents of this can for another use and open another can). Scoop the condensed coconut cream into a medium mixing bowl, leaving the more clear coconut \u201cwater\u201d behind (you can save the coconut water for smoothies or discard it). Add the peanut butter, sweetener and vanilla extract. Using an electric hand mixer, beat the mixture until it is smooth and light, with soft peaks.",
            "To finish the chocolate layer: Once the chocolate has cooled, open another chilled can of coconut milk. Scoop the condensed coconut cream into a clean, medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the semi-cooled chocolate, sweetener, vanilla and salt. Using an electric hand mixer, beat the mixture until it is smooth and somewhat fluffy. Taste and add additional sweetener if desired, keeping in mind that once chilled, it will taste slightly less sweet.",
            "Scoop the chocolate mixture into the baked tart crust. Use a rubber or silicone spatula to evenly distribute the filling and smooth the top. Rinse off and dry your spatula, then use it to spread the whipped cream layer on top, leaving an inch bare around the edges so the chocolate layer remains visible. Chill the tart for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours or longer, so the coconut whipped cream has time to set.",
            "Before serving, sprinkle with cocoa powder and/or sprinkle, if desired. If your tart pan has a removable bottom, carefully remove the tart so it\u2019s easier to slice through the edges. Slice the tart into even wedges using a sharp chef\u2019s knife, wiping off the blade after every slice. Serve immediately. This tart keeps well, chilled and covered, for up to 5 days."

            "To prepare the spaghetti squash, preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy clean-up. Use a very sharp chef\u2019s knife to cut off the tip-top and very bottom ends of each spaghetti squash. Stand the squash upright on a stable surface and slice through it from top to bottom to divide it in half. Repeat with the other squash.",
            "Use a large spoon to scoop out the spaghetti squash seeds and discard them. Drizzle each squash half with 1 teaspoon olive oil and rub it all over the inside and outside of the squash, adding more oil if necessary. Sprinkle salt and pepper lightly over the interiors of the squash, then place them cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 40 to 60 minutes, until the interiors are easily pierced through with a fork.",
            "Meanwhile, to prepare the chickpea salad, combine the chickpeas, bell pepper, onion, olives, chopped basil and/or parsley, garlic, lemon juice, remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and salt. Stir to combine. Taste, and add more lemon juice and/or salt if necessary. Set aside.",
            "To prepare the pesto: In a small skillet, toast the pepitas over medium heat, stirring often, until they are fragrant and making little popping noises, about 5 minutes. Pour the pepitas into a food processor and let them cool for a few minutes. Then, add the basil, parsley, lemon juice, water and salt. Process while slowly drizzling in the olive oil, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary, until the pepitas have broken down to create a pretty smooth sauce. Transfer the pesto to a small bowl for serving.",
            "To assemble, use a fork to fluff up the squash and make it easier to eat. Then divide the chickpea salad between the squash \u201cbowls\u201d and top each one with a generous drizzle of pesto. Finish with a sprinkle of chopped herbs and cheese, if desired. Serve immediately. Leftovers keep well for about 3 days; if you plan to have leftovers, store the pesto separately and top the squash with it just before serving."

Slice across the butter to make even cubes. Repeat with the remaining stick of butter. Toss about half of the cubed butter into the bowl.",

Drizzle 4 tablespoons ice water over the mixture and stir to combine. Repeat with an additional 2 tablespoons ice water, stirring to combine, and again with another 2 tablespoons. Mix with a spoon until it starts coming together into a workable dough. The mixture should be moist enough that you can squeeze it between your palms and it will stick together; if it won\u2019t, try adding another two tablespoons of water or more, just until the mixture sticks together. Divide the mixture into two equally sized halves.",

Add the raspberries and gently toss with a spoon to coat the berries in a light, even layer. Place the bowl in the refrigerator to chill for now.",
            "To prepare the hand pies: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. On a floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll half of the chilled pie dough into a circle about 12-inches across and between \u215b\u201d to \u00bc\u201d thick. Use the top of a drinking glass 3 \u00bd\u201d in diameter (a working glass is perfect) to cut 12 circles. Re-roll the scraps if necessary. Carefully transfer each round to your prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pie dough.",
            "Brush half of the rounds with egg wash, then top each of those rounds with a heaping tablespoon of raspberry filling (about 7 raspberries per hand pie). Place another round on top of each raspberry-covered round. With a fork, gently press down on the outer \u00bc\u201d of the rounds to seal the hand pies, working your way around until they are completely sealed. Gently poke a few holes on the top of each hand pie with the tines of your fork, then brush egg wash on top of each hand pie. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the hand pies are deeply golden brown. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let the hand pies cool for at least 30 minutes before glazing.",
            "To prepare the glaze: In a small bowl, combine the powdered sugar, orange juice, maple syrup, orange zest, cinnamon and salt. Whisk until the mixture is well blended and completely smooth. It should be thick but pourable (if it\u2019s too thick to drizzle, mix in a bit more orange juice). Use a spoon to drizzle a striped pattern back and forth over the cooled hand pies. Wait for 5 to 10 minutes for the glaze to set and then serve! Leftover hand pies are best stored covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days."

Place the eggplant pan on the middle rack and the other vegetables on the top rack. Set the timer for 15 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and \u00bc teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is tender and caramelizing on the edges, about 8 to 10 minutes.",
            "Add the garlic, stir, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, and use a wooden spoon or sturdy silicone spatula to stir any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan into the mixture. Reduce the heat to medium-low, or as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer.",

        "description": "Try this vegetarian riff on a BLT sandwich! Instead of bacon, this recipe uses pan-fried halloumi cheese, which is similarly chewy, salty, golden and tasty. Recipe yields 2 large or 3 medium sandwiches, depending on the size of your bread.",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 large or 6 medium slices of sourdough bread",
            "2 medium-to-large ripe red tomatoes",
            "Flaky sea salt or kosher salt",
            "6 ounces halloumi cheese",
            "\u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil, for frying",
            "Freshly ground black pepper",
            "6 tablespoons mayonnaise, or as needed",
            "6 tender green lettuce leaves (I like butter lettuce)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Lightly toast each slice of bread, and set aside. Slice your tomatoes into thick rounds (a little over \u00bc\u2033 thick) and sprinkle them lightly with flaky salt or kosher salt. Set aside.",
            "Slice the halloumi into \u00bc\u201d wide strips no longer than your bread. Using a clean tea towel or paper towel, gently pat dry any pools of moisture on the cheese (less water means less splattering). Place the cheese near the stove.",
            "In a medium skillet (I love to use cast iron) over medium heat, warm the olive oil over medium heat. We want the oil warm enough that a slice of cheese, once added, quickly starts bubbling around the edges. Using kitchen tongs, carefully place slices of halloumi into the hot oil (be careful, the oil can splatter). Leave a little room around each piece of cheese so they don\u2019t stick together (I usually cook the cheese in two batches). I recommend covering the skillet to contain any splatters.",
            "Cook the cheese until the undersides are deeply golden, about 2 to 4 minutes (if it\u2019s taking forever to brown, raise the heat a bit; if it\u2019s browning very quickly or you catch any whiff of smoke, turn down the heat). Carefully flip each piece of cheese with the tongs, recover the skillet, and cook until the other side is deeply golden, about 2 to 4 minutes.",
            "In the meantime, place a few paper towels on an empty plate or cutting board to absorb excess oil. Place each piece of cooked cheese onto the plate, sprinkle heavily with freshly ground black pepper, and let the cheese cool down a bit before handling.",
            "To assemble your sandwiches, first spread mayonnaise generously over two slices of bread (if making two sandwiches) or three (if making three sandwiches).",
            "Top each of the remaining plain slices of toast with two to three lettuce leaves. Top the lettuce with tomato slices, lightly overlapping them for full coverage. Top the tomatoes with slices of cheese, again overlapping them for full coverage. Top with the remaining slices of bread, mayo side down.",
            "Enjoy the sandwich whole, or use a sharp chef\u2019s knife to slice them in half. These sandwiches are best served fresh, but will keep for about 24 hours in the refrigerator."

You will likely have to do this in a couple of batches, depending on the size of your blender (never fill your blender past the maximum fill line). Being careful to avoid hot steam escaping from the lid, blend on low and slowly increase the speed until the soup is completely smooth.

If you need to make your own oat flour, blend 1 and \u00be cups oats in a blender or food processor until ground into a fine flour.",

Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, until fragrant (7 minutes for thinner/smaller/chopped nuts and about 10 for whole pecans). If you\u2019re using large nuts like pecans, transfer them to a cutting board and chop them into small pieces with a chef\u2019s knife.",

            "Carefully dump the fudge mixture into your lined square baker. Use the back of a sturdy mixing spoon to push the mixture across the baker so it\u2019s roughly evenly distributed. Cover the bottom side of a thick, heavy-bottomed drinking glass or mason jar with parchment paper and press it down on the fudge repeatedly until the fudge is evenly packed. If you\u2019re finishing the fudge with flaky sea salt, lightly sprinkle some on top now and gently press it into place with the bottom of your parchment-covered glass.",
            "Cover and freeze the fudge for 30 to 45 minutes, until it\u2019s firm to the touch and no longer shiny in the middle. If you\u2019re not in a hurry, you can refrigerate the fudge for a couple of hours or longer.",
            "Use a chef\u2019s knife to slice the fudge into 1 \u00bc-inch wide columns and rows. Fudge will keep well for a couple of days at room temperature, or for a few weeks in the freezer, sealed in an air-tight freezer bag."

            "Add the cumin and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained beans and water. Stir, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, then remove the lid and use a potato masher or the back of a fork to mash up about at least half of the beans. Continue to cook the beans, uncovered, stirring often, for 2 to 3 more minutes, until thickened.",
            "Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the pepper and lime juice. Taste and add more salt, pepper or lime juice if necessary. If the beans seem dry, add a very small splash of water and stir to combine. Cover until you\u2019re ready to serve.",
            "Meanwhile, warm the salsa. Pour the salsa into a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring the salsa to a simmer, stirring occasionally, and then reduce the heat to low until you\u2019re ready to serve. (Or, warm the salsa in a bowl in the microwave\u2014it won\u2019t condense as much but it\u2019ll work!)",
            "In a small skillet over medium heat, warm each tortilla individually, flipping as necessary. Spread the black bean mixture over each tortilla and place each tortilla on an individual plate. If using Jack cheese, sprinkle it over the tortillas. Set aside.",
            "To fry the eggs: In the same skillet over medium heat, pour in 1 teaspoon olive oil and wait until it\u2019s shimmering. Carefully crack an egg and pour it into the skillet without breaking the yolk. Fry the egg, lifting and tilting the pan occasionally to redistribute the oil, until the whites are set and the yolk is cooked to your preferred level of doneness. Place the fried egg on top of a prepared tortilla and repeat with the remaining eggs.",
            "Spoon about one-fourth of the warmed salsa across each dish, avoiding the egg yolk. Use a slotted spoon or fork to do the same with the pico de gallo, leaving the messy tomato juices behind. Sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper and add any additional garnishes you might like.",
            "Serve immediately. If you don\u2019t use up all of your beans, leftovers are a great dip for tortilla chips."

Whisk together 2 tablespoons olive oil, the juice of 1 lime and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Drizzle over the kale and toss to coat.",

Spread the rice in an even layer on the bottom of the pot and let the rice lightly brown. This happens quickly! When the rice starts to brown, stir it and spread it out in an even layer again so that more of the rice browns.",

If you have any extra marinated broccoli rabe and beans, they are great accompaniments, as are guacamole and salsa verde. Recipe yields 4 quesadillas (each made from 1 tortilla folded in half, for a visual).",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 large bunch of broccoli rabe (about 1 pound)",
            "Small handful of chopped fresh cilantro",
            "1 tablespoon olive oil",

Tear any large leaves into small, bite-sized pieces, then transfer the leaves to a large serving bowl, along with the chopped cilantro.",
            "In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, lime juice, garlic, salt and red pepper flakes. Whisk until blended. Pour the dressing over the leaves and gently massage the dressing into the leaves until they are all lightly coated. Take a little bite, and add more lime juice and salt if you find it too bitter.",
            "To cook the refried beans: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the shallot and salt. Cook, stirring often, until the shallot is tender and turning translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin and chili powder and cook, while stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the drained beans and water. Let the mixture come to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often, and reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Remove from heat and mash the beans with a potato masher, pastry cutter or fork until the mixture is thick and spreadable.",
            "To cook the quesadillas: Spread the bean mixture evenly over each tortilla. Warm a medium-to-large skillet over medium heat. Transfer one tortilla to the warmed skillet and sprinkle about one-fourth of the cheese over the bean mixture. Spread a handful of marinated broccoli rabe leaves over one-half of the tortilla, leaving any large buds in the bowl. Once the cheese is melting, fold the cheesy side over the broccoli rabe. Brush the top of the quesadilla lightly with oil. Once the cheese is fully melted, flip the quesadilla, and brush the top with oil. Let each side cook until golden and crisp, flipping as necessary. Transfer the cooked quesadilla to a plate, and repeat for remaining quesadillas.",
            "Let the cooked quesadillas rest for a few minutes to set the cheese, then use a pizza cutter or sharp chef\u2019s knife to slice each quesadilla into three wedges. Serve with any remaining marinated broccoli rabe or beans on the side, as well as salsa verde and/or guacamole for dipping."

You could also use oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, rinsed and patted dry.

Turn the bread onto the prepared baking sheet and arrange in a single layer. I couldn\u2019t quite mix in all of my Parmesan mixture, so I sort of lumped the excess on top of the bread pieces.

(If you must, you can gently warm the liquid mixture in the microwave or on the stovetop.)",

Add the chopped pecans and stir until they are evenly dispersed. The drier the mixture, the more firm the bars will be, so stir in extra oats if the mixture seems wet. Conversely, if you used a super thick nut butter, you might need to drizzle in another tablespoon of honey to help it all stick together.",
            "Transfer the mixture to the prepared square baker. Use your spoon to arrange the mixture fairly evenly in the baker. Cover the bottom of a flat, round surface (like a short, sturdy drinking glass) with a strip of parchment paper (see photo) and pack the mixture down as firmly and evenly as possible. Press the reserved pecan halves into the surface to create 4 even rows and 4 even columns (see photo).",
            "Cover the baker and refrigerate for at least one hour, or overnight. This gives the oats time to absorb moisture so the granola bars can set. When you\u2019re ready to slice, lift the bars out of the baker by grabbing both both ends of the parchment paper. Use a sharp chef\u2019s knife to slice the mixture into 4 even rows and 4 even columns (these \u201cbars\u201d stick together better in a square shape).",
            "For portability, you can wrap individual bars in plastic wrap or parchment paper. Bars keep well for a couple of days at room temperature, but I recommend storing individually wrapped bars in a freezer-safe bag in the freezer for best flavor. They\u2019ll keep for several months in the freezer."

Finally, add the egg and process until blended. Set aside.",

Otherwise, divide 1 cup marinara between a large (9\u00d713 inches) and medium-sized baker (say, an 8-inch square). You might need to add another splash of sauce to evenly coat the bottom of the pans.",

            "Final assembly: Add the grated cheese, cranberries and shallot to the bowl. Drizzle enough dressing into the bowl to lightly coat the leaves (you might not need all of it), then toss to coat. Add the roasted butternut and croutons and gently toss to combine. Drizzle in extra dressing if the salad seems like it needs it. For best flavor, let the salad rest for 10 minutes before serving."

        "ingredients": [
            "7 medium to large red bell peppers (around 3 \u00bd pounds), halved, seeded, membranes removed",
            "6 cloves garlic, in peel",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1 large yellow onion, chopped",
            "3 tablespoons tomato paste",
            "2 \u00bd teaspoons ground cumin",

        "instructions": [
            "Roast the peppers: Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit with racks in the upper third and lower third of the oven. Arrange your halved peppers, cut side down, in a single layer on a large, rimmed baking sheet (use two sheets if necessary). Place the whole cloves of garlic in between the peppers. Roast on the upper rack (and lower rack, if you\u2019re using two baking sheets) until peppers are blackened across the top, around 20 minutes.",
            "Steam and peel the peppers: Once the peppers are deeply blackened, remove them from the oven and use kitchen tongs to transfer the peppers to a medium-sized bowl and cover (or transfer them to a plastic bag and seal). Let the peppers steam for at least 10 minutes. Remove the cover and let them cool until they are manageable. Use your fingers to peel off the charred top layer of skin and discard (you may want to wear kitchen gloves for this). Peel the skin off the garlic, too.",
            "In a 3 \u00bd quart or larger Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, warm 2 tablespoons of olive oil, then add the chopped onion, peeled whole garlic cloves and a sprinkle of salt. Saut\u00e9, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and turning translucent, about 5 to 8 minutes.",
            "Cook the soup: Add the tomato paste, cumin, paprika, salt and optional cayenne pepper and cook for one minute, while stirring constantly. Add the peeled red peppers and vegetable stock and stir. Bring the soup to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
            "Meanwhile, make your crispy tortilla strips: Warm 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Once warmed, add the tortilla strips and a dash of salt. Stir to coat the strips, then arrange them in roughly an even layer in the pan and let them cook, stirring occasionally, until both sides are golden and crispy, about 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate linked with a paper towel to cool.",
            "Optional but recommended step (yields super creamy soup): Whisk together \u00bd cup water with arrowroot or cornstarch until thoroughly blended. During the last minute of soup cooking time, pour the water/starch mixture into the soup and stir to blend. Once your soup is done cooking, remove it from heat and allow it to cool for 5 minutes.",
            "Blend the soup (two options): For the creamiest soup, transfer soup to a stand blender in batches (do NOT fill your blender over halfway, soup will go everywhere!) and cover the top of the blender with a thick layer of kitchen towel (so the steam doesn\u2019t burn your hands, be careful). Transfer pur\u00e9ed soup to another pot or a bowl and continue until all of the soup is blended. Or, use an immersion blender to blend the soup in the pot. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. If you did not add the \u00bd cup water and starch mixture earlier, taste your soup and decide if you want to stretch out the soup with \u00bd cup water (in which case, stir it in now) or leave it as is.",
            "If necessary, transfer soup back to your cooking pot and rewarm gently on the stove. Divide soup into individual bowls. Top with crispy tortilla strips, diced avocado, chopped cilantro, optional crumbled feta and a light sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper. Serve!"

The drier the mixture, the more firm the bars will be, so stir in extra oats if the mixture seems wet. Conversely, if you used a super thick almond butter (cough, Justin\u2019s), you might need to drizzle in another tablespoon of honey to help it all stick together.",
            "Transfer the mixture to the prepared square baker. Use your spoon to arrange the mixture fairly evenly in the baker, then use the bottom of a flat, round surface (like a short, sturdy drinking glass) to pack the mixture down as firmly and evenly as possible. (If the mixture keeps sticking to the glass, cover the base of the glass with a small square of parchment paper.)",
            "Cover the baker and refrigerate for at least one hour, or overnight. This gives the oats time to absorb moisture so the granola bars can set.",

            "For portability, you can wrap individual bars in plastic wrap or parchment paper. Bars keep well for a couple of days at room temperature, but I recommend storing individually wrapped bars in a freezer-safe bag in the freezer for best flavor. They\u2019ll keep for several months in the freezer."
