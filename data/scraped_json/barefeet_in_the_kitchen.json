If it becomes too sticky and wet, add just a tablespoon or so more flour. The photo on the left is too wet, the one on the right (with the spoon in the bowl) is perfect.

            "To Shape Pierogies: Divide the dough into four sections and roll out one of the sections very thin, to about 1/8\" thickness. (This should be just a bit thinner than a pie crust.) Cut into circles and place 1 tablespoon of the potato filling on one side. Fold over the circle and pinch around the dough. Place the prepared pierogies in a single layer onto a waiting plate. Don't stack them or the dough will stick together.",
            "To Boil Pierogies: Drop the waiting pierogies into the water, a few at a time. Use a spoon or spatula to gently nudge them off the bottom of the pot if they stick. When they float to the surface of the water, lift them out carefully with a slotted spoon. Place them on a buttered plate and drizzle a small amount of melted butter on top of them to prevent sticking together. Let the boiled pierogies cool for a few minutes before frying them.",
            "To Fry Pierogies: In a large skillet over medium heat, melt a tablespoon of butter. When the butter sizzles, place the boiled pierogies in the skillet in a single layer. Let them cook 2-3 minutes, until lightly browned on the edges, flip over and repeat. The pierogies will not turn brown all over, but the edges should crisp and be light brown. Remove the finished pierogies to a buttered baking dish."

            "Day One: Mix all ingredients except the flour in a large bowl or a lidded (not airtight) storage container. I use a plastic shoebox size container with a lid that simply clicks on and off. If you do not have a lid that is NOT airtight, you can drill or cut a small hole in the lid and vent it that way.",
            "Next, add in the flour and stir until combined. Let this rest on the counter, covered, in the non-airtight container, for approximately 2-3 hours. The dough should rise and then collapse (flatten on top). Store this dough in the refrigerator for 2-5 days.",
            "On Baking Day: Lightly flour a baking sheet or pizza stone and set aside. Wet your hands first and then remove a 1/3 portion of your dough. It will be very sticky and wetting your hands makes it much easier to handle. Keeping your hands wet, quickly shape the dough into a ball and stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all sides, rotate the ball as you go around it shaping the dough.",
            "Place the dough (folded ends tucked underneath) on a pizza peel (or directly on your baking sheet if you do not have one). Allow it to rise for 1 hour and 40 minutes. Flour the top of the loaf and slash, using the tip of a serrated knife.",
            "Twenty minutes before it's time to make the bread, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place an empty broiler tray on the lowest shelf of the oven. I keep a baking pan in the oven that I use just for this purpose. If your dough is rising on a pizza peel, put the stoneware in the oven now to heat.",
            "Transfer your dough from the peel to the stone that is now hot in the oven. If your bread is rising on a baking sheet already, simply place the baking sheet in the oven. Pour 1 cup of hot water into the broiler tray (or pan) in the bottom of the water. Quickly close the oven door. This is essential for breads with a cracked crust. The steam from the water creates the lovely crust.",
            "Bake for 50-60 minutes or until deeply browned and firm. Allow the bread to cool completely before slicing."

Warm the tortillas just slightly in the microwave and then loosely wrap them in a towel on the counter. (Warm tortillas will fold and roll much more easily without cracking.) Combine the two cheeses in a bowl next to the tortillas.",

Fold the sides in and then place the roll seam side down in the bottom of the pan. Repeat until the pan is tightly packed with rolled tortillas. I typically fit 12-14 tightly packed corn tortillas in the bottom of the 9x13 pan or approximately 8 flour tortillas. When all the mixture has been rolled into the tortillas, pour the remaining cup of green chile sauce (and any remaining chicken mixture or sauce left in the pan over the rolled tortillas and top generously with the rest of the cheese.",

Let rest 10-20 minutes on the stove-top prior to serving. It will firm up and be much easier to slice after it has cooled a bit. Garnish individual servings with cilantro and sour cream just before serving. Enjoy!"

Bring to a boil and the reduce the heat slightly, allowing the sauce to lightly boil as it reduces by almost half, into a sticky syrupy sauce. This should take about 10-15 minutes.",

Fry the chicken until it is golden brown, this took about 4-5 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oil using kitchen tongs and drain on paper towels.",

It really does work (Thanks, Leesa!) and there isn't a vinegar smell that remains later either. Simply toss the vinegar down the drain when you are finished cleaning up after the meal."

            "Stir together the salt, chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne. Tie the roast with cooking twine. You can watch a quick how to video here. (Tying isn't required, but it will help ensure an evenly cooked roast.) Set the roast on a rack over a baking tray or inside a roasting pan. Use a pastry brush to coat the roast generously with the honey mustard. Place the roast fat side down and sprinkle the roast with about 1/3 of the spices. Turn the roast over, so the fat side is on top, and sprinkle the top and sides with the remaining spices. A good rule of thumb is to sprinkle the roast until the spices no longer stick to it. I used about 2/3 of the rub.",
            "Make sure the roast is still fat side up and cover lightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Remove the roast from the refrigerator and set it on the counter about half an hour before cooking. (You can also cook it straight from the refrigerator, just expect to add a few minutes cooking time.)",
            "Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Uncover the roast and place it in the center of the very hot oven. Roast for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 300 degrees, continue cooking for 45 minutes, or just until the roast hits 130 degrees. Remove from the oven and let the meat rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing. Enjoy!"

Prepare the pork belly by scoring the skin with a very sharp blade. (I used this inexpensive utility cutter and it worked perfectly.) You want to cut lines through the skin, about half an inch apart all the way across the pork belly, without cutting too much of the fat and exposing the meat. There should be stripes across the whole belly where you have scored the skin. Place the scored pork belly on a large baking sheet or roasting pan, preferably with a wire rack underneath the pork.",
            "Drizzle the pork with oil and rub it all over both sides of the meat. Sprinkle the pork belly all over with salt, taking care to generously rub it into the slits you've made on the skin. Sprinkle with pepper. Place the pork on the middle oven rack and roast at 450 degrees for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees and roast an additional 25 minutes per pound. For a 2 1/2 pound roast this is approximately an hour more. Test the roast by poking a skewer into it and seeing if the juices are clear or still milky white.",
            "Increase the heat to broil and move the roast to the oven shelf under the broiler. Set a timer and broil the roast for 60 seconds, check it and broil an additional 30 seconds, but only as needed! When all of the skin has bubbled up and is puffy, crackling, and golden brown. Remove from the oven and let the meat rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing. Enjoy!"

Serve warm or at room temperature. Enjoy!",

Combine the peach filling ingredients in a large ziploc bag, press the air out and freeze flat. When you are ready to bake the cobbler, thaw in the refrigerator and then pour into the baking dish and proceed with the recipe."

            "After the beans are sorted, pour them into the crock-pot. You don't want your beans to fill the pot more than about a third full. They will expand greatly as they cook. Now, fill the pot most of the way with water and cover with lid.",
            "Soak the beans for 8-24 hours. I try to soak mine 24 hours most of the time. When you are ready to cook them, just drain the water, refill with clean water and turn the Crock-pots on to low or high depending on what works best for you.",
            "I recommend cooking beans on low. I get the best results when cooking on low. However, I have cooked them on high numerous times if I needed them to be finished in time for dinner that night. Either way works, just stay aware of how close to finished they are. It's easy to overcook when the beans are on high.",
            "Different beans require different cooking times. I recommend cooking beans on low and after about 6-8 hours, start checking them every 30-60 minutes to see when they are soft.",
            "Once they are cooked, simply pour them into a strainer and wait for them to cool. Once they are mostly cool, scoop them into freezer bags for later use. I store my bags flat in the freezer. When things are stored flat, it makes it very easy to thaw and use in just minutes."

Set a brown paper bag near the stove and let the mixture boil until it matches the bag in color. This takes between 18-20 minutes and I ALWAYS set a timer. Just in case I find myself distracted, the timer prevents me from letting the candy burn. It will go from amber colored to burnt in about 30 seconds, as soon as it turns light brown, pull it off the heat.",

Line the pretzels up touching each other to cover most of the baking sheet. Once the toffee is caramel colored, remove from the heat and add the vanilla. Stir to combine. Quickly pour the toffee over the pretzels. Let it cool completely. I like to set the pan in the refrigerator to speed up the process, but it will also cool at room temperature.",

The chocolate can also be melted in a microwave at 50% power, checking and stirring every 60-90 seconds. Spread the warm chocolate across the toffee and then place in the refrigerator to cool completely. Once cooled, break into pieces. (I found it easiest to turn the whole sheet of toffee over and tap firmly on the toffee side with a wooden spoon to break it into pieces.) Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Enjoy!"

Set the tray in the refrigerator while you preheat the grill to medium-high heat.",

Place the cold burgers on the grill and don't touch them again until they are browned on the bottom and about halfway up the sides, about 4 minutes. You should be able to easily slide your spatula under them. If flames flare up from the fat in the burger, spritz the burgers with a little water.",

Transfer the burgers over to one side of the grill and turn the burners off under the burgers and adjust the other burners to medium-low heat. This allows the burgers to finish cooking over indirect heat. When the interior temperature is 5\u00b0F below the point you like it, (rare: 125-130\u00b0F, medium: 140-150\u00b0F, well: 160-170\u00b0F), lay the slices of cheese over each burger and transfer the burgers to a clean tray.

Once they are completely cool, wrap in saran wrap and freeze for a couple hours before assembling the cake.",

            "With this cake, it is a good idea to make a crumb coat with the first layer of frosting. Basically, just make sure the cake is covered in frosting, even if a few stray crumbs show through. Chill the assembled cake again (place it back in the freezer for half an hour or so) before you add the last bit of frosting. Use the remaining bit of frosting to create a smooth final coating."

            "Combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Stir to combine. Add the oil, sour cream, and eggs. Beat with an electric mixer to combine. Gradually add in the water, vinegar, and vanilla and continue beating to combine. Divide the batter evenly between the three cake pans.",
            "Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out almost clean with just crumbs. Remove from the oven and let the cake cool in the pans for 20 minutes.",
            "Very carefully, invert the cakes onto wire racks and let them cool COMPLETELY. These are very soft cakes. If desired, once the cakes are completely cool, wrap in saran wrap and freeze for a couple of hours before assembling the cake.",
            "FROSTING DIRECTIONS",
            "In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese and butter until smooth and fluffy. Add the peanut butter and beat to combine. Gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, mixing thoroughly after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl often.",
            "To frost the cake, place one layer flat side up on a serving plate or stand. Spread about 2/3 cup of the Peanut Butter Frosting evenly over the top. Place the second layer on top and repeat. Place the last layer on top and frost the top and sides with all but about 1/2 a cup of the remaining frosting.",
            "Once the cake is fully frosted, chill it, to make sure the frosting is completely set before drizzling it with the glaze. The more set the first frosting is, the better the drip effect that will be created by the final glaze.",
            "GLAZE DIRECTIONS",
            "In a glass bowl over a pan of simmering water, combine the chocolate and the peanut butter. Cook, whisking frequently, until all of the chocolate has melted and the mixture is completely smooth. Remove from the heat and whisk in the half and half, beating until smooth again. Use while still warm.",
            "To glaze the cake, simple pour the chocolate glaze over the top of the cake. Using a large metal spatula (an offset one will work best for this), spread it evenly across the top of the cake just to the edges, so that it will create drips down the sides of the cake.",
            "Refrigerate uncovered for at least 30 minutes prior to serving. (If the cake chills for longer than that, or overnight, be sure to let it warm at room temperature for at least one hour before serving.)"

            "4 boneless skinless chicken breasts (approximately 2 lbs total)",
            "1 cup olive oil (divided)",
            "4 tablespoons soy sauce",
            "1 teaspoon kosher salt",

            "6 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (I used two large lemons)",
            "1/4 cup capers, rinsed",
            "optional: 1/4 cup fresh parsley (chopped)"

        "instructions": [
            "Place your chicken breasts in a gallon size freezer strength ziploc bag, one at a time, and pound them to an even 1/4\" thickness. Once they have all been thinned as much as possible, place them all back into the ziploc bag and add the soy sauce, 1/2 cup of olive oil, salt and pepper. Seal the bag and let the chicken rest on the counter for 10-30 minutes.",
            "Place two separate bowls next to your stove. In the first one, whisk the two eggs together. In the second one, combine the bread crumbs and the flour. Heat the remaining 1/2 cup of olive oil and 3 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. When the butter has melted and the mixture is hot, start making the chicken by dipping each piece first in the egg and then in the flour mixture, being sure to press it into the chicken on each side. Then place each piece right into the frying pan. I was able to cook two at a time in the pan.",
            "Brown well on each side, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the pan and reserve to a plate. Tent the cooked chicken with foil to stay warm while you prepare the sauce. (You can also place the covered chicken plate in the oven to keep warm if you would like. I found that mine stayed warm enough simply tented with the foil.)",
            "Add the sliced mushrooms and 3 tablespoons of butter into the frying pan that you just used. Saute the mushrooms over medium heat for 5 minutes. Then add the wine, lemon juice and capers to the pan.",
            "Use a spatula to scrape up all of the brown bits. Increase the heat to medium high and then let the sauce simmer for a few minutes while it reduces by half. (The brown bits will darken the sauce.) Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and stir to combine. Plate the chicken and pour the sauce over the top. Top with fresh parsley if desired. Enjoy!"

        "ingredients": [
            "1 pound ground pork (cooked and crumbled)",
            "1 8 ounce can water chestnuts (chopped)",
            "1 4 ounces can sliced mushrooms (chopped)",
            "1 4 ounce can large shrimp (chopped)",
            "1/2 cup green onions (chopped)",
            "1/3 cup sweet yellow onion (chopped)",
            "2 cloves fresh garlic (pressed)",
            "1/2 tsp kosher salt",
            "1/2 tsp sugar",
            "1/4 tsp pepper",
            "1 tsp soy sauce",
            "2 eggs beaten",
            "lumpia wrappers or spring roll wrappers",
            "2 cups oil for frying (I used refined coconut oil, flavorless and unscented)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Combine all ingredients except for the eggs in a bowl, and mix with your hands. (per Irene, this way it is with love!) After it's all mixed, cover it and let it sit in the fridge for an hour (or up to 24 hours) before wrapping.",
            "Open the lumpia wrappers and cut in half to form rectangular strips or in quarters to make bite size rolls. The lumpia wrappers are larger than most eggroll or spring roll wrappers. If you are using spring roll wrappers, you can cut them in half or leave them the bigger size.",
            "Carefully peel the wrappers apart and place about a tablespoon of filling on each one. Roll them according to your preference and then dip your finger in the beaten egg and seal the edges. Set the rolls aside until ready to cook. I found it was easiest to roll them all in an assembly line and then cook them in batches.",
            "In a small sauce pan, heat about 2 inches of oil over medium high. Once the oil is hot, use tongs to place a few rolls in the oil at a time. Let cook for about a minute on one side and then turn to cook the other. If the oil covers them completely, just turn as needed to make sure they are cooking evenly. When they are lightly golden brown, remove from the oil and place on a paper towel covered plate. Serve with dipping sauces of your choice. Enjoy!"

Place the steaks in the oven and cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 105\u00b0F for rare, 115\u00b0F for medium-rare, 125\u00b0F for medium, or 135\u00b0F for medium-well.",
            "This will take about 12-20 minutes for rare steaks and up to 40 minutes for medium-well, depending on the thickness of your steaks. Cooking times can and do vary greatly depending on many factors, so check the steaks frequently to avoid overcooking.",
            "Just before the steaks come out of the oven, add 1 tablespoon of oil to a cast iron or heavy stainless steel skillet. Heat over high heat until smoking. Add butter, if desired, and swirl the pan to melt. Add steaks to the skillet and cook until each side is well browned, about 40-45 seconds per side.",
            "Using tongs, hold each steak on its side to sear the edges. Remove from the skillet and let them rest for a couple of minutes prior to serving. There's no need for an extended rest with reverse seared steaks.",

            "Place the steaks on a plate or baking sheet and sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. Leave on the counter to warm slightly while the grill is heating. Place an internal thermometer in one of the steaks.",
            "Set up your grill for an indirect cook at 250\u00b0F. This means turning on one burner and leaving the others off while the lid is CLOSED. We set an oven thermometer inside the grill on the plates farthest from the heat. This is where the steaks were going to be cooked.",
            "When the thermometer registers 250\u00b0F, add the steaks to the grill. Set the thermometer to the side and CLOSE the grill. Cook the steaks over the indirect heat until the internal temperature is 125\u00b0F. This took 45 minutes for our steaks, but watch the thermometer not the clock, because the steaks are cooking by temperature, not time.",
            "Crank the heat to high for a few minutes with the grill OPEN, then move the steaks over the direct heat for just about 1 minute on each side. Remove from the grill and let them rest for a couple of minutes prior to serving. There's no need for an extended rest with reverse seared steaks."

            "1 2/3 cup water (warmed to about 120 degrees)",
            "2/3 cup milk (warmed to about 120 degrees)",
            "1/4 cup butter (melted)",
            "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1/4 cup honey plus 1 tablespoon (divided)",
            "1 tablespoon yeast",
            "3 cups whole wheat flour (I used freshly ground hard white wheat)",
            "2 - 3 cups all-purpose flour (I used 2 3/4 cups + an additional 1/2 cup, see note below)",
            "3 tablespoons wheat gluten"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In your mixing bowl, combine the 1/4 cup honey, warm milk, melted butter and salt. Add one cup of the warm water to this mixture and whisk to combine. In a small glass bowl or cup, combine 2/3 cup warm water, yeast and the last tablespoon of honey. Stir or whisk until the yeast is mostly dissolved. Let this yeast mixture rest about 5 minutes, or until it is bubbly.",
            "Add the wheat flour, 1 cup of AP flour and the wheat gluten to the mixing bowl. Stir briefly to combine and then add in the yeast mixture. Beat until combined and then continue beating the liquid dough for another couple of minutes. (This allows the gluten in the flours to start getting elastic, which creates a much smoother textured loaf.) After two minutes, add in 1 more cup of AP flour and mix to combine. (My dough was still very liquid at this point, so I added an additional 1/2 cup of flour to get the dough to a consistency I could dump out onto the counter.)",
            "Generously flour a countertop (I spread 1/2 cup of flour across the countertop) and begin kneading the dough. Basically, just flip the dough in half repeatedly, pressing down with the heel of your hand. Knead the dough for 5 minutes, adding just a little bit more AP flour at a time (only if necessary - I added 1/4 cup more AP flour total) if the dough is sticking to your hands or the counter. Per Jill's instructions, \"The key here is to add enough flour to keep the dough from sticking, but not enough to make the dough stiff. The dough should be soft, supple and smooth without being overly sticky. Err on the side of sticky, not dry. Too much flour during the kneading process will result in dry bread.\" Perfectly stated and for the first time ever, that is what I achieved! I think finishing the kneading process by hand is the key here.",
            "Place the kneaded dough back in the bowl, cover with a towel and allow it to rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. It should double in size. Punch the dough down again and turn it out on a lightly floured countertop. Divide the dough in half and gently shape one portion into a rectangle. I used a rolling pin to smooth it out just a bit and to remove air bubbles. Starting at the end closest to you, start tightly rolling the dough into a cylinder, the same way you would roll a sleeping bag. Poke the ends toward the middle as you roll, to help keep it's shape. (Again, look at Jill's original post here for step by step pictures) Once the bread is rolled, place it in a well greased bread pan and repeat with the other half of the dough. Allow the loaves to rise in a warm place (I kept mine on the stove) for 30-40 minutes, or until they are about an inch or so above the top of the pans. Check your dough as it is rising, if the kitchen is very warm, it might rise faster. If it rises too much, it will collapse and flattens on top. This will cause the bread to be dry. I let mine rise just a bit too much and it started to flatten. I'll watch it closer next time. I caught it before it collapsed, so it still tasted delicious though!",
            "Preheat the oven to 365 degrees, once the loaves have been rising about 20 minutes. Place the bread in the oven once it is heated. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when you tap them. Remove from the oven and immediately turn the loaves out onto a cooling rack. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",
            "FREEZER TIPS: I froze one loaf, wrapped well in aluminum foil. I sliced the other one the same day we made it. The frozen loaf thawed perfectly and sliced just as well a few days later."

            "Combine the milk and the vinegar and let it sit for a few minutes. Stir together the dry ingredients and set aside. Whisk the honey into the warm water and then add the milk/vinegar and oil. Whisk in the eggs and stir until well combined. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir with a spoon until the dough is between the consistency of mashed potatoes and biscuit dough. It should be wet and sticky. Let the dough rest for 20 minutes! (The resting time is crucial to the final result, if you skip resting the dough, the brown rice flour won't be absorbed and the texture will be gritty.)",
            "When you are ready to make the tortillas, heat a large non stick pan over medium high heat. Lightly dust a mat or countertop with a tablespoon of potato starch. The amount doesn't need to be exact, just lightly rub the potato starch across the surface with your hands, so the tortillas won't stick to the counter. You will dust your work surface with a fresh sprinkling of potato starch for every tortilla! (I used about 2 teaspoons for each tortilla.) This makes a huge difference in the ease of rolling out the tortillas.",
            "Scoop a golf ball size amount of dough and drop it onto the floured surface. Roll it around just a bit to lightly coat the dough with starch. Press down with your hands to flatten the dough. I flip it over a time or two, just to make sure it is coated in the starch to avoid sticking. Use a pastry roller or lightly dusted rolling pin to spread it out into a circle. Use a large spatula to transfer it to the hot pan.",
            "Cook on each side for 60-90 seconds, allowing it to brown and start to bubble before flipping it over. Wrap the tortillas in a thin tea towel to keep them warm until ready to eat. Serve immediately or let cool and store in an airtight container until ready to serve. Reheat for 10-15 seconds in the microwave or in a hot skillet, just before serving. The tortillas should keep nicely at room temperature for a day or two. Enjoy!"

Remove from the oven and let the chicken rest for at least 15 minutes before serving. If you cut into it earlier, the juices won't have a chance to distribute fully through the meat and they will drain out onto the cutting board. Enjoy!"

Stir constantly as the flour begins to brown. When it is about the color of caramel, place it in the gumbo mixture. Test to make sure the soup is hot enough first, by dropping a teaspoon of the browned flour into the soup. You should hear a sizzling sound. If it sizzles, add the rest of the flour.",

            "While using an electric mixer (hand mixer, or stand), slowly pour in the warm milk. The mixture will be mostly crumbs at first, but once all the milk is added, it will begin to come together. Add 4 tablespoons of softened butter and beat until thoroughly blended.",
            "Add the eggs, one at a time. Beat the mixture after each egg is added, until it is thoroughly integrated before adding the next one. Once you\u2019ve added all the eggs, beat the mixture at high speed for 3 minutes. This adds air to the thick batter, which helps take the place of the missing gluten as far as structure is concerned. It will create a much fluffier loaf of bread, similar to store bought varieties.",
            "At the end of 3 minutes, the batter will look like thick, heavy buttercream icing: smooth and silky. It should not look at all like a typical yeast dough. The dough will be very sticky, and feel a bit gritty if you rub some between your fingers. Scrape the sides of the mixing bowl and leave the batter right in the bowl to rise for the first time.",
            "Cover the bowl with a light towel or loose plastic wrap and let the thick batter rise for 90 minutes. This batter might not completely double in size, but it will puff up considerably.",
            "Lightly grease a 8 1/2\u201d x 4 1/2\u201d loaf pan with butter. Gently stir the batter down. Scrape it into the prepared pan. The dough should still be wet and not at all knead-able. It reminds me of a very thick brownie batter at this stage. Using dampened fingers, or a wet spatula or bowl scraper; smooth the top, eliminating as many wrinkles, bubbles or creases as possible. The smoother your loaf is before this final rise, the smoother it will be once it\u2019s baked. After the dough rises and bakes, the top of the loaf will look very much the same as it looks when you finish smoothing it out. It is worth a minute or two of effort to make it as smooth as possible now.",
            "Loosely cover the pan with a towel (or a lightly greased piece of plastic wrap) and let the dough rise until it barely crowns over the rim of the pan. This will take 45 \u2013 60 minutes, or possibly as much as 90 minutes, depending on the temperature of your kitchen. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
            "This dough is fairly delicate. Try not to touch it again at all. Any finger touch or bump will be visible after the bread is baked.",
            "Bake the bread for 25 minutes, until golden brown. Remove it from the oven, and using hotpads for both hands, immediately turn it out of the pan onto a rack. Brush with a very small amount of melted butter to help keep the crust soft, and add flavor. Slice when completely cool. Enjoy!"

An inexpensive bottle of gin, such as Seagram's, works well for an infusion like this one. For 750 mil of gin, use about half a cucumber.
