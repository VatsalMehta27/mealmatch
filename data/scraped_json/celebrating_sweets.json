Add egg and vanilla, beating until combined and scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Beat in the flour mixture until fully combined. Add the chocolate chips and malted milk balls, mixing until combined (I mix them in by hand with a wooden spoon).",

Place on the lined baking sheets with several inches in between each dough ball. If desired, you can press a few chocolate chunks/chips onto the top of each dough ball.",
            "Bake*** for 9-11 minutes, until the edges are just beginning to set and the centers are still underdone. The cookies should be so soft that if you tried to pick them up off the baking sheet they would fall apart. Place the baking sheets on cooling racks and cool completely, they will firm up as they cool. See recipe notes regarding optional step of shaping the cookies after baking. If desired, sprinkle the tops of the cookies with flaky sea salt."

Note: this whipped cream is sweetened slightly since the filling is so sweet. If you'd prefer the whipped cream sweeter you can add an additional 1-2 tablespoons of powdered sugar. Spread the whipped cream over the pie or use a pastry bag and piping tip (I used a large open star tip) to add the whipped cream to the top of the pie.

            "Dry ingredients",
            "In a separate bowl, combine flour (see note), baking powder, cornstarch, and salt. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat until combined.",
            "Remove half of the dough from the mixing bowl and spread the remaining dough out across the bottom the mixing bowl. Remove the cinnamon mixture from the freezer and use two spoons to scoop small pieces (about a teaspoon each) of the cinnamon mixture and place them all over the dough in the mixing bowl. Once you have used half of the cinnamon mixture, get the cookie dough that you have set aside, and spread it or press it with your fingers into a somewhat even layer on top of the cinnamon and dough in the mixing bowl. Proceed to add the remaining cinnamon mixture (in little pieces) all over the top of that piece of dough. Your bowl should now have two layers of cookie dough, each layer topped with cinnamon sugar bits.",
            "Once you have your dough layered you are going to fold and mix it just barely. I do two folds, scraping up and over, followed by one to two stirs by hand with a rubber spatula. Do not use an electric mixer, this needs to be a brief stir that leaves some pieces of the cinnamon mixture in chunks and some pieces swirled into the dough.",
            "Scoop the dough into two-tablespoon portions using a cookie scoop. Pay attention while scooping to ensure that each scoop has a fair amount of dough mixed with cinnamon. Place the dough balls on a plate and freeze for 10 minutes. This quick chill firms up the butter so the cookies don't spread too much.",
            "Bake",
            "Place dough balls a couple inches apart on parchment lined baking sheets. For thicker cookies leave the dough balls in higher mounds, for thinner cookies give them a slight pat down before baking. Any dough balls that do not fit into this batch that's baking should be refrigerated (not frozen) until the baking sheets have cooled and you're ready to bake them.",
            "Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the cookies have spread, the edges are beginning to brown and the center is still slightly underdone. Some of the cookies will bake up a little misshapen. This is because pockets of cinnamon sugar might melt out while baking. Don't worry, I have two techniques that work for getting a perfectly round shape for every cookie in the batch! See notes for shaping cookies as soon as they come out of the oven. Place baking sheets on wire racks and allow cookies to cool completely. They will firm up as they cool."

Add the flour mixture, coconut, and pecans to the wet ingredients and use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir until the batter is fully combined (at least 15 strokes). Set aside briefly while you prepare the fudge filling.",
            "Fudge filling: Add chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, and butter into a microwave safe bowl. Microwave in 15 seconds increments, stirring well between each, until melted and smooth. This took me about 45 seconds.",
            "Assembly: Scoop half the blondie batter into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer. Drizzle the melted chocolate over the top and spread into an even layer. Top with the remaining blondie batter. The easiest way to do this is to place blobs of blondie batter all over the chocolate layer. Moisten your fingertips with water and flatten and spread the blondie batter into an even layer. Sometimes I leave a little bit of chocolate exposed on the sides of the pan. If desired, you can sprinkle the top of the bars with flaky sea salt. Bake in the lower third of the oven for about 30 minutes, until light golden brown. Be careful not to overbake. Place pan on a wire rack and cool completely."

Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well between each addition and scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla.",
            "Dry ingredients",
            "In a separate bowl combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the flour mixture into the butter mixture and beat until combined, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.",
            "Add dates to batter",
            "After the dates have soaked for 20 minutes, mash or puree the dates along with the liquid. If the dates you used were moist you should be able to mash them easily with a fork. If the dates were really dry it will likely be easier to use an immersion blender or small food processor to puree (they don't have to be completely smooth). Transfer all of the date mixture into the cake batter and beat until combined.",
            "Bake",
            "Grease ramekins (preferred)** or see notes for other pan sizes. Transfer the batter to the prepared pans and smooth the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Depending on the size of your ramekins this can be anywhere from 20-25 minutes. Be careful not to overbake. Place on a wire rack to cool.",

            "Toffee sauce",
            "In a medium saucepan, melt the butter. Add the cream, brown sugar, molasses, and salt. Bring the mixture to a simmer, whisking occasionally, and simmer for 5-8 minutes. Whisk in vanilla and set aside to cool slightly; it will thicken as it cools.",
            "Assembly and serving:",
            "Remove cake from pan",
            "While the cakes are still a little bit warm, remove them from the ramekins/muffin tin and place them on a baking sheet or a piece of foil or parchment paper. Note: the cakes will likely have a dome on top. If desired, you can use a serrated knife to level off the top. I prefer to level it off and serve the cakes upside down.",
            "Brush with sauce",
            "Brush all sides of the cakes with the toffee sauce, reserving the rest of the sauce for serving.",
            "Serve the cake warm, drizzled with extra toffee sauce. Garnish with heavy cream, whipped cream, ice cream, and/or a sprinkle of flaky sea salt."
