Next, add the melted butter, egg, and egg yolk, vanilla extract, unsweetened applesauce, and cinnamon to the yeast mixture and whisk together until well combined.",

Use a wooden spoon to stir in the flour until a well combined dough forms, being sure to incorporate all of the flour from the sides of the bowl.

            "Use a spatula or knife to spread the softened butter evenly over the dough and then sprinkle the brown sugar mixture over the butter, being sure to cover all of the edges of the dough. Use your fingers to press the cinnamon sugar mixture into the butter a bit. Next, top the dough evenly with the diced apples.",
            "Tightly roll up the dough, on the long side, and place the log seam side down. Pinch the seam a bit so the rolls don\u2019t unravel. Use a sharp serrated knife or unflavored dental floss to cut the roll into 12 equally sized pieces.

            "Warm the milk to 110-115 degrees Fahrenheit and then transfer to a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle the yeast on top of the warm milk and then sprinkle the granulated sugar over the yeast. The yeast should begin to foam and become frothy. If after 5 minutes the yeast still does not start to foam or become frothy, throw out the milk mixture and start again with new yeast. Next, add the melted butter, egg, and egg yolk, vanilla extract, pumpkin puree, and pumpkin pie spice to the yeast mixture and whisk together until well combined.",
            "Add the flour and salt to the wet ingredients. Use a wooden spoon to stir in the flour until a well combined dough forms, being sure to incorporate all of the flour from the sides of the bowl. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s time to move on to the next step once it becomes hard to stir. The dough will be thick and shaggy that\u2019s still quite a bit sticky and that\u2019s ok!",
            "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and then use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until it becomes elastic and can easily form into a smooth ball. The dough should feel slightly tacky but it should not stick to your hands or the kneading surface. If the dough is still too sticky after kneading for a few minutes, add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time and continue to knead the dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball.",
            "Grease a clean, large bowl with one teaspoon of avocado oil and then transfer the ball of dough to the greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and let the dough rise in a warm area (like the top of your oven/stovetop) for 1 \u2013 1 1/2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size.",
            "While the dough is rising, make the filling by combining the dark brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, and vanilla extract in a small bowl.",
            "Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the extra air and then transfer to a lightly floured surface. Shape the dough into the shape of a rough rectangle and then use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a 20\u00d716 rectangle that is roughly 1/4 inch thick.",
            "Use a spatula or knife to spread the softened butter evenly over the dough and then sprinkle the filling mixture over the butter, being sure to cover all of the edges of the dough. Use your fingers to press the cinnamon sugar mixture into the butter a bit.",
            "Tightly roll up the dough, on the long side, and place the log seam side down. Pinch the seam a bit so the rolls don\u2019t unravel. Use a sharp serrated knife or unflavored dental floss to cut the roll into 12 equally sized pieces. Place the cinnamon rolls in a 9\u00d713 casserole dish, lined with parchment paper, evenly spaced apart. You should have 3 rows with 4 rolls per row.",
            "Cover the casserole dish with a tea towel and let the cinnamon rolls rise for another 25-30 minutes or until they have almost doubled in size.",
            "Bake the cinnamon rolls on the center rack at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until the rolls are a light golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. Remove the cinnamon rolls from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before icing.",

            "Add the cream cheese, butter, and confectioner\u2019s sugar to a mixing bowl. Use a hand mixer to mix the frosting until it is fluffy and the confectioner\u2019s sugar is well incorporated without any lumps. Next, add in the vanilla extract and pumpkin pie spice. Mix on high again until well combined. Set aside."

            "1 cup buttermilk, warmed to 110-115 degrees Fahrenheit",
            "2 \u2013 1/4 oz packets active-dry yeast",
            "1/3 cup granulated sugar",

        "instructions": [
            "Warm the buttermilk to 110-115 degrees Farenheit and then transfer to a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle the yeast on top of the warm milk and then sprinkle the granulated sugar over the yeast. The yeast should begin to foam and become frothy. If after 5 minutes the yeast does still not start to foam or become frothy, throw out the milk mixture and start again with new yeast. Next, add the melted butter, egg, and egg yolk to the mixture and whisk together until well combined.",
            "Add the all purpose flour and salt to the wet ingredients and use a wooden spoon to stir in the flour until it is well combined a dough forms, being sure to incorporate all of the flour from the sides of the bowl. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s time to move on to the next step once it becomes hard to stir. The dough will be thick, shaggy dough that\u2019s still quite a bit sticky and that\u2019s ok!",
            "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and then use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until it becomes elastic and can easily form into a smooth ball. The dough should feel slightly tacky but it should not stick to your hands or the kneading surface. If the dough is still too sticky, add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time and continue to knead the dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball.",
            "Grease a clean, large bowl with one teaspoon of avocado oil and then transfer the ball of dough to the greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and let the dough rise in a warm area (like the top of your oven/stovetop) for 1 \u2013 1 1/2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size.",
            "While the dough is rising, make the filling by combining the dark brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and orange zest in a small bowl.",
            "Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the extra air and then transfer to a lightly floured surface. Shape the dough into the shape of a rough rectangle and then use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a 20\u00d716 rectangle that is roughly 1/4 inch thick.",
            "Use a spatula or knife to spread the softened butter evenly over the dough and then sprinkle the filling mixture over the butter being sure to cover all of the edges of the dough. Use your fingers to press the cinnamon sugar mixture into the butter a bit.",
            "Tightly roll up the dough, on the long side, and place seam side down. Pinch the seal a bit so the rolls don\u2019t unravel. Use a sharp serrated knife or unflavored dental floss to cut the roll into 12 equally sized pieces. Place the cinnamon rolls in a 9\u00d713 casserole dish, lined with parchment paper, evenly spaced a part. You should have 3 rows with 4 rolls per row.",
            "Cover the casserole dish with a tea towel and let the cinnamon rolls rise for another 30-45 minutes until they have almost doubled in size.",
            "Bake the cinnamon rolls on the center rack at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until the rolls are a light golden brown. Be sure to check the middle rolls to ensure they\u2019re fully baked. You can lightly tent the rolls with foil if they begin to become too brown. Remove the cinnamon rolls from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before icing.",

            "Add the cream cheese, butter, and confectioner\u2019s sugar to a mixing bowl. Use a hand mixer to mix the frosting until it is fluffy and the confectioners sugar is well incorporated without any lumps. Next, add in the orange juice and vanilla extract and mix on high again until well combined. Set aside."

            "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add a tablespoon of avocado oil and then add in the shrimp. Cook the shrimp 2-3 minutes until almost cooked through. Remove from the pan and then set aside.",
            "Keep the skillet set to medium-high heat. Add the broccoli florets to the pan along with 1/3 cup of water. Cook the broccoli until it is bright green and slightly tender but still has crunch; around 4-5 minutes depending on the size of the broccoli florets. The water will evaporate while the broccoli cooks.",
            "Next, add the shrimp back to the skillet and then add the stir fry sauce. Give everything a stir to combine and cook for 1-2 more minutes. The sauce should thicken a bit as it cooks.",
            "Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the sliced green onions. Garnish with sesame seeds and then serve the stir-fry immediately over rice. Eat and enjoy!"
