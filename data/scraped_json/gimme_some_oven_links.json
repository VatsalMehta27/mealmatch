Add the flour mixture and egg, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Continue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the dough hook and cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes.",

(If you want all edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into a perfect rectangle.) Use a knife or spoon to spread the Nutella evenly over the top of the surface, leaving a 1/4-inch border at the bottom of the 14-inch edge (so that the Nutella doesn\u2019t ooze out). Sprinkle the cinnamon evenly on top of the Nutella. (If it\u2019s too thick, pop the Nutella in the microwave for a few seconds to make it easier to spread.)",

Use a piece of dental floss*** to \u201ccut\u201d off the two ends of the roll (an inch on each end \u2013 discard that dough) so that they are even. Then cut the remaining dough into 11 or 12 equal pieces. (11 rolls seem to fit in a pie plate, while 12 rolls fit in a rectangular pan.)",

Add the guanciale to the pan and cook, stirring and flipping occasionally, until the guanciale is golden brown and crispy and the fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. (Keep a close eye on the guanciale so that it does not burn.) Using a slotted spoon, transfer the guanciale to a separate plate. Pour the remaining fat into a heatproof measuring cup. Measure out \u00bc cup of the fat to save, then discard the rest.",
            "Simmer the sauce",
            "Carefully add the wine to the saucepan and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits stuck left on the bottom of the pan while the wine simmers. Use your hands to roughly crush the tomatoes into small pieces, then add them to the saucepan. Add the crushed red pepper flakes, cooked guanciale, the reserved guanciale fat and stir to combine. Let the sauce continue to simmer on medium-low while the pasta cooks, stirring it occasionally and adding in a \u00bc cup of the starchy pasta water if the sauce starts to seem too dry.",
            "Boil the pasta",
            "Once the pasta water reaches a rapid boil, add the pasta. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is about 2 minutes shy of al dente. (The center of the pasta should still have just a slight crunch.)",

            "Use a spider strainer or tongs to immediately transfer the pasta to the saut\u00e9 pan with the tomato sauce. (Be sure to save all of the remaining starchy pasta water in the stockpot.) Gently toss the pasta continuously in the sauce for 2-3 minutes until the pasta is al dente, adding in an extra \u00bc cup of the remaining starchy pasta water as needed anytime the sauce seems too dry.",

Then look for the ridges (see video) where the pomegranate arils reach the outer edges of the pomegranate, and use your knife to carefully score the outside skin along those ridges.",
            "Then (option 1) completely submerge one pomegranate half in the bowl of water, and spread the pomegranate open into a flour. Use your fingers to carefully separate the arils from the rind, gently prying the rind apart more and more to reveal all of the arils. Or (option 2) firmly hold the pomegranate arils-side-down right above the water, and use a strong wooden spoon to hit the outside pomegranate skin on all sides until the arils drop down into the water.",

And then use your fingers to once more pick through all of the arils that are sitting on the bottom to remove any tiny pieces of rind that are still stuck to individual arils. Remove and discard this rind.",

            "Pour the milk into a microwave-safe bowl. Heat on high in the microwave for 30 seconds, then remove and stir in the melted brown butter, and test the temperature with your finger. You want the mixture to be lukewarm, but not hot to the touch. If it is too cool, continue heating the mixture in the microwave for 20 second intervals, pausing after each to stir, until the mixture reaches the correct temperature. If the mixture gets too hot, let it sit out for a few minutes until it has cooled to the lukewarm temperature.",

Add the flour mixture and egg, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Continue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the dough hook and cover the bowl with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes.",

(If you want all edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into a perfect rectangle.) Use a knife or pastry spatula to spread the melted brown butter evenly over the entire surface of the dough. Then sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar mixture evenly on top of the melted butter so that the entire surface of the dough is covered.",
            "Beginning at the 14-inch edge, tightly roll up the dough. And then give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss*** to \u201ccut\u201d off the two ends of the roll (an inch on each end) so that they are even, then discard the dough that was cut away. Use the floss to cut the remaining dough into 12 equal pieces.",

Then very carefully slide the middle of the floss under the dough to the place where you want to \u201ccut\u201d. Then pull the ends of the floss up and cross over the top of the dough, and give a quick tug to literally cut all the way through the dough. This is the best method for not squishing your dough while cutting it \u2014 although the standard knife method still works too.)",

Bake for about 60-70 minutes, removing 2-3 times during baking to re-baste with the butter that will collect on the bottom of the baking sheet. Bake until the centers of the potatoes are cooked, and the edges are slightly crispy and a little wilted around the edges. The potatoes will fan open a bit during cooking.",

Use your hands to knead the dough for 2-3 minutes in the mixing bowl until it is smooth and forms a cohesive ball. The dough\u2019s texture should feel springy and firm, similar to Play-Doh.

(The dough will still be slightly sticky, but should form into a ball that pulls away from the sides of the mixing bowl. If it\u2019s too sticky, add a bit more flour.)",

Grease the mixing bowl (or a separate bowl) lightly with cooking spray, then place the dough ball back in the bowl and cover it with a damp towel. Place the bowl in a warm location (I set mine by a sunny window) and let it rise for 1 hour until the dough has nearly doubled in size.",

Cut the dough into 8 equally-sized wedges and roll each wedge into a ball with your hands. Then use a rolling pin to roll out the dough ball until it forms an oval about 1/4-inch thick.

Flip the dough and cook on the second side for 30-60 seconds, or until the bottom is golden as well, then transfer the dough to a clean plate. (If you are making garlic naan, brush one or both side(s) of the dough with the garlic butter once the naan has cooked.) Sprinkle the naan with a pinch of flaky sea salt, if desired. Then lightly cover the naan with a clean towel so that it stays warm. Repeat with remaining dough until all of the naan pieces are cooked, adjusting the heat of the pan if needed to keep it hot (but not overly-hot so that it burns the bread).",

The crust of the loaf will probably be quite hard, so use a large serrated knife such as a bread knife for this job.",

If the biscotti are placed too close together, they could get a little soft or soggy as they cool.",

Then continue heating in 15-second increments (carefully) and stirring in between until chocolate is melted. (I usually add in a little shortening to help it melt and avoid burning.) Then just dip a fork in the chocolate and swish it over biscotti to drizzle, or you can pour it in a Ziplock or pastry bag (with a tiny corner snipped out) and squeeze it out.",

            "4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, that have been pounded to even thickness and brined in saltwater (*see easy instructions below)",
            "4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced",
            "3 tablespoons melted butter",
            "2 tablespoons freshly-squeezed lemon juice",
            "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves",
            "1 teaspoon Kosher salt",
            "1/2 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper",
            "optional garnishes: fresh lemon slices, extra fresh thyme sprigs"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "*To brine your chicken breasts, simply fill a large bowl with 1 quart of warm water and 1/4 cup kosher salt. Stir to combine until most of the salt is absorbed. Add the chicken breasts and let them sit in the mixture to brine for 15 minutes. Or you can also also cover the bowl and refrigerate for up to 6 hours. Remove the chicken breasts from the brine, rinse them with cold water, then pat them dry with some paper towels.",
            "Heat oven to 450\u00b0F.",
            "In a medium bowl, whisk together the garlic, melted butter, lemon juice, and thyme until combined. Set aside.",
            "Pour the melted butter mixture into a large baking dish, and place the chicken breasts on top of it in an even layer. Use a pastry brush to brush the butter mixture all over the chicken breasts until they are completely coated on both sides. Then sprinkle each chicken breast evenly with a generous pinch of salt and pepper.",
            "Then feel free to add in a few extra lemon slices to the mix to look pretty when it all bakes up. (Although disclaimer \u2014 I don\u2019t recommend eating these or laying them directly on top of the chicken breasts, since they get a little bitter the longer they cook.)",
            "Bake for 5 minutes. Then remove the pan from the oven and brush the chicken again thoroughly with the butter mixture. Bake again for 5 minutes, remove and brush. Bake again for 5-8* minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink. (So the chicken will bake for 15-18 minutes total. If you use a cooking thermometer to measure the temperature thickest part of the breast, it should be between 160-170\u00b0F. The FDA recommends 170\u00b0F.)",
            "*Or, if you want the chicken to be a little bit browned and crispier on top, you can turn the broiler on high for the final 3-5 minutes and broil the chicken until it is cooked through and extra browned on top. Keep a close eye on the chicken so that it does not overcook and/or burn.",
            "Once the chicken is cooked, remove the pan from the oven and brush the chicken thoroughly with the butter mixture once more. Loosely cover the pan with aluminum foil, and let the chicken rest for at least 5-10 minutes. Serve immediately, garnished with extra lemon slices and thyme sprigs if desired.",
            "Or, refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months."

Continue heating in 20 second intervals, pausing after each to stir, until the butter is melted and the milk is warm to the touch but not hot. If needed, let the milk mixture sit for a few minutes until it is warm but not hot.",
            "In the bowl of a stand mixer (*see note below for an alternative method of making this by hand*) fitted with the dough hook attachment, add 3 cups flour, yeast, sugar and salt. Stir by hand to combine. Add the egg and milk mixture, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. Add the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, beating after each addition until incorporated. When the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, you have added enough flour. Continue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the dough hook and cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, begin making your filling by whisking together sugars and cinnamon in a bowl until combined.",
            "When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Then use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 14 x 9 inches in size. (If you want all edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into a perfect rectangle. Don\u2019t worry about cutting away extra dough \u2014 this recipe makes plenty.) Use a knife or pastry spatula to spread the softened butter out evenly over the entire surface of the dough. Then sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon and sugar mixture. Then sprinkle on the finely chopped apples, and drizzle with 1/2 cup caramel sauce.",
            "Beginning at the 14-inch edge, tightly roll up the dough. And then give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss* to \u201ccut\u201d off the two ends of the roll (just a centimeter or so) so that they are even. Then cut the remaining dough into 11 or 12 equal pieces. (11 rolls seem to fit in a pie plate, while 12 rolls fit in a rectangular pan.)",
            "(*To cut dough with dental floss, simply break off a piece of floss about 12 inches long. Then very carefully slide the middle of the floss under the dough to the place where you want to \u201ccut\u201d. Then pull the ends of the floss up and cross over the top of the dough. Then give a quick tug to literally cut all the way through the dough. This is the best method for not squishing your dough while cutting it \u2014 although the standard knife method still works too.)",
            "Place each of the cut cinnamon rolls into a greased pie plate or 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Then cover again with a damp towel, and leave the dish in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes. (I typically turn on my oven to 200 degrees, then turn it off and place the dish in the oven with the door cracked open. It\u2019s a great option if you don\u2019t have a vent or a warm window nearby.)",
