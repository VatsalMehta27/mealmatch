            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter (melted and cooled)",

        "instructions": [
            "Prepare the potatoes.",

            "Let the potatoes cool slightly, then peel them. I use a vegetable peeler but a carefully wielded sharp knife will do.",
            "Mash the peeled, cooked potatoes. If you have a potato ricer or food mill, use it to mash the potatoes until smooth. Otherwise, mash with a fork until as smooth as possible.",
            "Prepare the gnocchi dough.",
            "Place the mashed potatoes in a large bowl, add the butter and salt, and mix to combine. Cover the bowl and place the mashed potatoes in the refrigerator to chill until no longer warm (about 20 minutes).",
            "Remove the potatoes from the refrigerator, uncover the bowl, and add almost all the flour and xanthan gum, reserving a few tablespoons.",
            "Mix with a spoon and then switch to kneading the dough together with clean hands. It should hold together well when squeezed and feel firm but not dry.",
            "If the dough seems too soft, add more flour by the teaspoonful and knead it in. You can always add more flour, but you can\u2019t remove it so proceed carefully.",

            "Pull off pieces of dough about a handful at a time and place on a very lightly floured flat surface.",
            "Squeeze the dough firmly between your palms and then roll either between your palms or with your palms on the flat surface, pushing away from your body.",
            "Squeeze together any cracks in the dough with your fingers and roll into a cylinder. After you have rolled a few ropes, let them sit undisturbed for a few minutes to give the dough a chance to absorb the moisture of the potatoes.",
            "Cook the gnocchi.",
            "While the dough is sitting, bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil over medium-high heat.",
            "Once the water has boiled, cut the ropes into approximately 1-inch pieces with a sharp knife, and then mark each with the back of the tines of a large fork to make ridges.",
            "In batches of about 20, gently drop the dumplings into the boiling water and allow the gnocchi to cook for about 3 minutes, or until they all float to the top.",
            "Remove the cooked gnocchi with a slotted spoon and place on serving dishes. Repeat with the remaining dumplings.",
            "Serve immediately with tomato sauce, grated or shaved cheese, and fresh herbs, if you like.",
            "Make ahead ideas.",

Add more milk by the 1/4-teaspoon, mixing to combine well, until the glaze falls off the spoon slowly, in a thick but pourable glaze. Add milk very slowly, as it is much easier to thin, than to thicken, the glaze. If you do thin the glaze too much, add more confectioners\u2019 sugar a teaspoon at a time to thicken it. Immerse each cooled donut and donut hole in the glaze and lift out with the tines of a fork or chocolate dipping tool, allow excess glaze to drizzle off, and place on a wire rack to allow any excess glaze to drip off. Allow the glaze to set at room temperature before serving. The glaze will keep the donuts fresh, uncovered on the kitchen counter, for at least a day."

            "In a double boiler or a medium-sized microwave safe bowl, melt the chocolate and 8 tablespoons butter until both are melted and smooth.",
            "If you are using the microwave method, microwave in 30-second increments at 70% power, stirring in between intervals, taking care not to burn the chocolate. Set the mixture aside to cool briefly.",
            "Beat the egg whites.",
            "In a large bowl with a handheld mixer, or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the 2 egg whites on medium-high speed until soft peaks form. (For a slightly fluffier cake, separate one of the 3 whole eggs and add one more white here.)",
            "Add about half of the sugar and about half of the cocoa powder to this mixture, and beat on medium speed until well-combined and glossy. Go slowly at first, because cocoa powder resists combining.",
            "Adding cocoa powder to the egg whites makes it easier to incorporate them into the rest of the mixture later without deflating the whites.",

            "Add the melted chocolate and butter mixture, whisking constantly, until fully combined. Continue to whisk until the mixture is smooth and glossy.",
            "Fold the egg white and cocoa powder/sugar mixture into the batter carefully but completely. The mixture will be thickly pourable.",
            "Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and smooth the top carefully using a small offset spatula or knife. Tap the pan gently on the counter to break any very large air bubbles.",

            "If you are using a dark-colored springform pan, begin checking at 20 minutes to ensure that the cake doesn\u2019t burn. Remove the pan from the oven and place the cake on a wire rack, still in the pan, to cool completely. It should take about an hour to cool in the pan fully.",
            "Place the cooled cake in the refrigerator, still in the pan, and chill for 1 hour (or longer) before unmolding it from the springform pan.",

            "Set the container aside for at least 2 hours at room temperature, and up to 24 hours in the refrigerator. Do not let the dough rest/rise for too long, or your rolls will rise much more irregularly after shaping.",

Add the cornflake crunch, chocolate chips and marshmallows with the reserved dry ingredients, and mix gently until just combined, taking care not to crush any of the cornflake crunch. The cookie dough will be thick. Cover the bowl of cookie dough tightly with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to chill for about 1 hour.

Add the butter, oil and milk, then attach the dough hook to the stand mixer, and mix on low speed until combined. Raise the mixer speed to medium and mix for about 5 minutes. The dough should be smooth and stretchy. Spray a silicone spatula lightly with cooking oil spray, and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl or proofing bucket large enough for the dough to rise to double its size, and cover with an oiled piece of plastic wrap (or the oiled top of your proofing bucket). Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours and up to 5 days. (See Recipe Notes)",

Repeat scraping and folding until the dough has become smoother. Do not overwork the dough or you will incorporate too much flour and it will not rise properly. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 1-inch thick, sprinkling very lightly with flour to prevent sticking. With a floured round cookie cutter about 1-inch in diameter, cut out rounds of dough and place each piece on a greased, parchment-lined baking sheet.

Clip a deep-fry/candy thermometer to the side of the pot or fryer, and place the oil over medium-high heat. Bring the oil temperature to 350\u00b0F. Place the raised donut holes a few at a time in the hot oil, taking care not to crowd the oil. Fry for about 2 minutes per side or until they are brown all over. When the donuts first begin to fry, they will become lighter in color, and then will brown. Remove them before they become very dark. As soon as each batch is removed from the fryer, place on a wire rack placed over paper towels to drain and cool completely.",

Add more milk by the 1/4-teaspoon, mixing to combine well, until the glaze falls off the spoon slowly, in a thick but pourable glaze. Add milk very slowly, as it is much easier to thin, than to thicken, the glaze. If you do thin the glaze too much, add more confectioners\u2019 sugar a teaspoon at a time to thicken it.",

            "In a large bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum, baking powder and salt, and whisk to combine well. Add the chopped and chilled butter, and toss to coat it in the dry ingredients. Flatten each chunk of butter between your thumb and forefinger. Add 1/3 cup of water and mix until the dough begins to come together. Add the remaining water by the teaspoon until no part of the dough is crumbly. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured piece of unbleached parchment paper and press into a disk. Sprinkle the dough lightly with more flour, and roll it out into a rectangle that is about 1 inch thick, moving the dough frequently and sprinkling it lightly with flour if it begins to stick.",
            "Fold the dough over on itself like you would a business letter. Sprinkle the dough again lightly with flour, and roll out the dough once again into a rectangle about 1 inch thick. Twice more, remove the top piece of parchment paper, sprinkle lightly with flour, and fold the dough over on itself like you would a business letter. This will smooth out the dough and make it quite easy to handle. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to chill.",
            "Make the pie shell.",
            "Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F. Grease a 9-inch metal pie plate generously and set aside. Remove the pie dough from the refrigerator. Place on a lightly floured piece of unbleached parchment paper, dust lightly with flour, and roll into a 12-inch round, about 3/8-inch thick.",
            "Roll the pie crust loosely on the rolling pin and then unroll it over the prepared pie plate. Press the pie crust gently into the bottom and up the sides of the pie plate and, with kitchen shears, trim the excess crust so that only 1/4-inch of excess is overhanging the plate. Tuck the 1/4-inch of excess under itself, and crimp the edge gently all the way around the crust. Pierce the bottom of the pie crust with the tines of a fork and place the pie plate in the freezer to chill for 5 minutes.",
            "Bake the pie shell.",
            "Remove the pie plate from the freezer and place a large piece of unbleached parchment paper in the center of the crust. Place pie weights or dried beans in a single layer in the center of the pie crust, on top of the paper. Place in the center of the preheated oven and bake for 8 minutes.",
            "Remove from the oven and remove the paper and pie weights. Return to the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 375\u00b0F. Continue to bake until the crust is lightly golden brown all over (8 to 10 minutes more). If you don\u2019t bake the crust until it is golden brown all over, your pie will have a soggy crust once it is filled. Remove the pie crust from the oven and allow it to cool completely.",
            "Make the filling.",
            "In a small bowl, place the water, sprinkle the gelatin on top, mix to combine and allow to sit for about 2 minutes so the gelatin can bloom (it will swell). In a medium-sized, heat-safe bowl, place the flour blend, sugar and salt, and whisk to combine well. Add 1/2 cup (4 fl. oz.) of the milk, and then the egg yolks, whisking to combine after each addition until smooth. Set the mixture aside.",
            "In a medium-sized heavy-bottom saucepan, place the remaining 1 3/4 cups (14 fluid ounces) milk and the root beer, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the hot milk and root beer mixture to the bowl with the egg mixture in a slow trickle, whisking constantly to combine.Once all of the hot milk has been added, pour the whole mixture back into the saucepan and return to the heat. Cook, whisking constantly, over medium-high heat until thickened enough that the whisk leaves a visible trail in the mixture as you whisk it (2 to 3 minutes).",
            "Add the bloomed gelatin and mix to combine well. Remove the pan from the heat, and add the chopped butter and the vanilla, and stir until the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth. Pour the filling into the cooled shell and spread into an even layer. Allow the filling to cool for about 5 minutes. Cover the pie with plastic wrap, placing the plastic directly on the surface of the filling to avoid its developing a pudding \u201cskin.\u201d Place in the refrigerator to chill until set (at least 2 hours and up to 2 days).",
            "Make the topping and serve.",
            "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the heavy whipping cream and the confectioners\u2019 sugar on medium-high speed until stiff (but not dry) peaks form (about 3 minutes).",
            "Remove the plastic wrap from the chilled pie and spread the whipped cream on top. Slide the pie out of the shell onto a cutting board before slicing with a wet knife, placing a maraschino cherry on top of each slice and serving."

            "Prepare the raw bread dough.",
            "Place the bread flour, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of your stand mixer, and use a handheld whisk to combine well. Add the salt, and whisk to combine.",
            "Add the butter, egg, and milk, and mix by hand (with a large mixing spoon or Danish whisk) until just combined.",
            "Place in the stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, and mix on medium speed for about 5 minutes. The dough will be quite sticky, but should be smooth and stretchy.",
            "Spray a silicone spatula lightly with cooking oil spray, and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl or proofing bucket large enough for the dough to rise to double its size, and cover with an oiled piece of plastic wrap (or the oiled top to your proofing bucket).",
            "Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours and up to 5 days.",
            "Alternative method to use the dough the same day.",
            "To use the dough the same day it is made, after making the dough, set the covered dough to rise in a warm, draft-free environment to allow it to rise to double its size (about 1 hour).",
            "Once it has doubled, place it in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes or until it is chilled. This will make it much easier to handle. Then, continue with the rest of the recipe instructions.",

            "Line a large rimmed baking sheet with unbleached parchment paper, and set it aside.",
            "Turn out the chilled dough onto a lightly floured surface and using a very light touch, sprinkle the dough with more flour and knead it lightly until it\u2019s smoother.",
            "Fold the dough over on itself, and knead again, sprinkling very very lightly with more flour only as essential to prevent sticking. Do not work too much additional flour into the dough or you will lower the hydration ratio and the dough will not rise properly.",
            "On a lightly-floured surface with a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a 6-inch x 8-inch rectangle, a bit more than 1/2-inch thick.",
            "Using a pizza cutter or metal bench scraper, cut out 12 approximately 2-inch squares of dough, each with 4 very blunt edges.",
            "Place the rolls about 2 inches apart from one another on the prepared baking sheet, cover with lightly oiled plastic wrap, and set in a warm, draft-free location to rise until nearly doubled in size (about 45 minutes, but rising time will vary greatly depending upon the rising environment).",
            "As the dough is nearing the end of its final rise, preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F.",
            "Once the dough has finished rising, place the 3 tablespoons unsalted butter and honey in a small, heat-safe bowl, and heat in a short burst in the microwave or in a double boiler until melted.",
            "Mix the honey and butter together well, uncover the rolls, and brush each generously but carefully with the honey butter.",
            "Place the pan in the center of the preheated oven and bake until the tops of the rolls are lightly golden brown (about 12 minutes).",
            "Remove the rolls from the oven and brush once more with the honey butter before serving warm.",
            "Store any leftovers, once completely cooled, in a tightly sealed freezer-safe bag in the freezer. Refresh very briefly in the microwave before serving."

            "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, place the flour, xanthan gum, tapioca starch/flour, buttermilk blend, yeast, cream of tartar, baking soda, and brown sugar, and whisk to combine well, breaking up any lumps in the brown sugar. Add the salt, and whisk again to combine.",
            "Add the apple cider vinegar, butter, egg whites, and water, and mix to combine well. Turn the mixer speed up to medium-high and then high speed and beat until the dough almost seems whipped. The dough should pull away easily from the sides of the bowl when you use a silicone spatula to scrape it down.",
            "Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl or proofing bucket large enough for the dough to rise to nearly double its size.",
            "Spray the top of the dough very lightly with cooking oil spray. Cover the bowl very tightly with an oiled piece of plastic wrap or the oiled top of your proofing bucket.",
            "Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least an hour and up to 24 hours.",
            "When you are ready to shape and bake the bread, grease an 8 1/2-inch x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan and set it aside.",
            "Place all the filling ingredients except the butter in a small bowl, mix well, and set aside. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and turn it out onto a lightly flour surface.",
            "Turn the dough over on itself, sprinkling it lightly with more flour as necessary to prevent it from sticking. Use a large rolling pin to roll the dough into a thick 7-inch x 12-inch rectangle, still sprinkling very lightly with more flour as necessary in sticky spots.",
            "Dust any excess flour off the top of the rectangle and, using a small offset spatula or a large wide knife, spread the softened butter into an even layer across the top of the dough, leaving a small clean edge (about 1/2-inch) all around. Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the top of the butter and press down to help the mixture adhere.",
            "Starting on a short side of the dough, roll it tightly away from your body, pressing the seam to seal as you go, and finishing the with seam side down. Lift the loaf carefully, trying to prevent any filling from falling out, and place it in the center of the prepared loaf pan. Cover the pan with a lightly greased piece of plastic wrap and place it in a warm, draft-free location to rise until about 150% of its original size (about 1 hour).",
            "Once the dough is nearly at the end of its rise, preheat your oven to 325\u00b0F.",
            "Once it has finished rising, remove the plastic wrap and, using a lame or small, sharp knife, slash down the center of the loaf, lengthwise, at a 45\u00b0 angle and about 1/3-inch deep. Brush the top of the loaf, including inside the slash, generously with the egg wash.",
            "Place the pan in the center of the preheated oven and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the loaf from the pan, place it in a lined baking sheet, and place it back in the oven.",
            "Continue to bake until the loaf is lightly golden brown, feels firm when pressed down lightly in the center, and the internal temperature reaches about 195\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer (about 15 minutes more).",
            "Remove the loaf from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing and serving."

Return the pan to the heat and continue to stir vigorously for about 3 minutes, until the mixture begins to pull away from the sides of the pan and comes together in a ball. A thin film will form on the bottom of the pan. Remove from the heat and allow the mixture to cool for about 3 minutes (this ensures that the mixture will not overheat your blender or food processor, and will not cook the eggs when they are added).

Close the lid and cook until steam stops escaping from the iron, between 4 and 5 minutes, depending again upon the capacity of your waffle iron. Remove the waffle from the iron and place on a wire rack. Repeat with the remaining batter. Once you have made all of the waffles,* using a sharp knife or kitchen shears, cut each waffle into strips about 1 1/2-inches wide. Using a pastry brush, coat each waffle strip with the melted butter and roll in the cinnamon-sugar coating, pressing gently to ensure that the coating adheres.",

Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is melted and the milk begins to simmer. While the chocolate is melting, in a separate small bowl, whisk the flour or cornstarch into the remaining 1/4 cup (2 fluid ounces) milk until smooth. Pour the flour and milk mixture into the saucepan, and stir to combine. Simmer the chocolate mixture, continuing to stir occasionally, until it coats the back of a spoon (about 2 minutes). Pour into a small container for dipping, and allow to cool to room temperature before serving as it will thicken as it cools. Serve the waffle strips with the chocolate sauce."

Using a sharp knife, pizza wheel or pastry wheel, cut a 3 1/2-inch x 1 1/2-inch rectangle out of each of the 4 corners of the dough rectangle.

Pull the flap taught over the filling. (Only the flaps on the ends will be pulled taut. The rest of the braid should be much looser, allowing room for expansion in the oven.)",

Stop braiding when you have reached the top two strips (one on each side) and the top flap. Pull the top flap taut up and over the end of the filling, and cover gently with the remaining two strips.",

            "10 tablespoons unsalted butter (chopped)",
            "1 1/4 cups granulated sugar",
            "3 eggs (at room temperature)",
            "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
            "1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder ((I prefer Dutch-processed; if you use natural, just add 1/8 teaspoon baking soda))",
            "7/8 cup finely ground oat flour (gluten free if necessary)",
            "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "5 ounces semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips"

            "Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F. Line an 8-inch x 8-inch square pan with aluminum foil (either nonstick, or grease regular foil with cooking oil spray), and set it aside.",
            "In a small saucepan, place the chopped butter and granulated sugar. Place over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until the butter melts and the mixture is gently simmering around the edges. Remove the mixture from the heat and set it aside to cool until it\u2019s no longer hot to the touch.",
            "In a large mixing bowl, place the eggs and vanilla, and beat with a handheld mixer until the mixture is a bit foamy.",
            "Once the butter and sugar mixture is no longer hot to the touch, add it to the egg mixture and beat with the handheld mixer on medium speed until very smooth and well combined.",
            "Add the cocoa powder to the mixing bowl and, with the mixer off, manually whisk the cocoa powder in just until the wet ingredients have absorbed the powder. Cocoa powder resists combining, so if you turn on the mixer right away, the powder will scatter.",
            "Turn on the mixer to medium-high speed and beat until the batter very well-combined. It should be thick and glossy.",
            "Add the oat flour and salt, and mix using a mixing spoon or spatula until just combined. Do not overmix.",
            "Add about 4 of the 5 ounces of the chocolate chips, and mix until the chips are evenly distributed throughout the brownie batter.",
            "The batter will be very sticky and thick. Scrape it into the prepared pan and smooth gently into an even layer with a slightly wet offset or silicone spatula.",
            "Sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips evenly across the top of the batter, and press gently with your fingers to help the chips adhere to the batter.",
            "Place the pan in the center of the preheated oven and bake for 20 minutes.",
            "Reduce the oven temperature to 325\u00b0F and continue to bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until the brownies appear set all the way to the center. The brownies should not jiggle when you shake the pan gently from side to side.",
            "The toothpick test is not useful here, so you\u2019ll have to judge doneness based on appearance.",
            "Remove the pan from the oven and allow the brownies to cool in the pan for about 1 hour or until the pan is no longer hot to the touch. The brownies will sink a bit as they cool, but they should sink evenly across the whole top.",
            "Place the pan in the refrigerator to chill for about 1 hour or until very firm. Remove from the pan, slice with a sharp knife into 9 equal pieces and serve."

            "Once the starter has finished rising, make the dough. Place the flour and yeast the bowl of your stand mixer, and use a handheld whisk to combine well. Add the salt, and whisk to combine. Add the olive oil, water, and risen starter to the bowl, and mix on low speed with the dough hook until combined. Raise the mixer speed to medium and knead for about 5 minutes. The dough will begin as a rough ball and become very sticky, but should be smooth and somewhat stretchy. Spray a silicone spatula lightly with cooking oil spray, and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl or proofing bucket large enough for the dough to rise to double its size, and cover with an oiled piece of plastic wrap (or the oiled top to your proofing bucket). Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours and up to 5 days. (See Recipe Notes)",
            "Once the pizza dough has finished rising in the refrigerator, it is best to work with it cold. Place a pizza stone (or overturned rimmed metal baking sheet) on the bottom rack of your oven and preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough until smoother as directed in These General Shaping Tips. Divide the chilled dough into two equal portions, and roll each into a ball. Sprinkle both lightly with flour, and cover one with a moist tea towel so that it doesn\u2019t dry out. Using well-floured hands and a rolling pin, as necessary, pat and roll out the first piece of dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch round, rotating the dough and flouring it frequently, to prevent sticking, as shown in the gluten free pizza shaping video. Roll and pat the dough more thickly as you work from the center of the dough to the edges to create a crust. Transfer the round of dough to a piece of unbleached parchment paper. Repeat with the second piece of dough.",
            "Top your pizza with sauce and cheese, then place the pizza, one at a time, on the pizza stone. Bake until the crust is browned and your toppings are cooked as desired (about 8 minutes, but time will vary depending upon toppings and taste). Allow the pizza to set for a few minutes before slicing and serving."

            "Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. Place one hand on each end of the braid, and press the ends gently toward one another to create a slightly wider, shorter braid. This will help the braid rise together and adhere to create a nice loaf.",

            "The dough should be a lovely, smooth, enriched dough. If necessary to achieve the desired texture, add the remaining 1 ounce of water and knead again until smooth. The dough should climb up the dough hook during kneading but remain intact and smooth.",
            "Spray a silicone spatula lightly with cooking oil spray, and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl or proofing bucket large enough for the dough to rise to double its size, spray the top of the dough with cooking oil spray, and cover with an oiled piece of plastic wrap (or the oiled top to your proofing bucket).",

            "Repeat scraping and folding until the dough has become smoother. This dough should not need much work to become smooth. Do not overwork the dough or you will incorporate too much flour and it will not rise properly.",
            "Shaping, filling and assembling the dough.",
            "Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with unbleached parchment paper and set it aside. On a lightly greased piece of unbleached parchment paper, using a floured rolling pin, roll the dough into a rectangle that is about 18-inches by 14-inches, and about 1/4-inch thick.",
            "In a small bowl, place all the filling ingredients and mix to combine well.",
            "With a large, dull knife or offset spatula, spread the filling evenly over the entire surface of the dough, leaving a 1-inch border clean all around the perimeter. Using the parchment paper to aid you, beginning at one of the long sides, roll the dough tightly into a cylinder and pinch the seam and the ends closed securely.",
            "Transfer to the prepared baking sheet, seam side down, join the ends together and pinch them closed securely. Sprinkle the top and sides of the dough generously with bread flour to provide the dough a cloak to rise into.",

            "As the dough is nearing the end of its rise, preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F.",
            "Baking the bread.",

            "To make the glaze, mix the confectioners\u2019 sugar, butter and 1 tablespoon milk into a thick paste. Add the remaining tablespoon milk one teaspoon at a time, mixing well, until you have a glaze that is smooth and thickly pourable.",
            "If it is very hard to stir, it needs another drop or two of milk. Set the glaze aside briefly.",
            "To make the colored sugars, divide the superfine sugar into 3 separate small bowls.",
            "To one bowl, add about 5 drops of yellow food coloring, and mix well, pressing the food coloring into the sugar with the back of a small spoon until the sugar is a uniform yellow color.",

            "Make the optional maple butter",
            "In a medium-size, heavy-bottom saucepan, place the chopped butter. Melt the butter over medium-low heat. Reduce the heat to low, add the brown sugar, and stir until the mixture is wet and grainy.",
            "Add the maple syrup and continue to cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to look smooth (about 3 minutes).",

            "Place the dough in a warm, draft-free environment to allow it to rise to about 1 1/2 times its original size (about 1 hour). Once it has risen, place the covered dough in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes or until it is chilled. This will make it much easier to handle.",
            "Preparing the dough for shaping.",
            "Line a large rimmed baking sheet with unbleached parchment paper, and set it aside. Turn out the chilled dough onto a lightly floured surface.",
            "Using the scrape and fold kneading method and a very light touch, knead the dough, sprinkling with flour when necessary to prevent it from sticking and turning the dough over on itself until it has become smoother.",
            "Do not overwork the dough or you will incorporate too much flour and it will not rise properly.",
            "Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and cover them lightly with a moist towel to prevent them from drying out.",
            "Make the filling.",
            "In a medium-size bowl, place the cream cheese, sugar, salt and vanilla, and beat with a handheld mixer with the regular whisk attachments until light and fluffy. Add the egg, and beat again until smooth.",
            "Preparing and filling the dough, plus final rise.",
            "Working with one piece of dough at a time and sprinkling very lightly with more bread flour as necessary to prevent sticking, roll the dough into an 8-inch square, about 1/4-inch thick. As you work, shift and move the dough frequently.",
            "Dust off any excess flour from the surface of the rectangle facing up, and spread about 1/4 cup of the filling in an even layer on the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border clean around the perimeter. Beginning at one side of the dough, roll the filled dough tightly into a cylinder, like a jelly roll. Pinch the ends closed tightly and tuck them under the bread toward the seam on the underside. Place the filled dough, seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet.",
            "Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough, placing them at least 3 inches apart from one another on the baking sheet.",
            "Cover the baking sheet with a piece of oiled plastic wrap, and place in warm, draft-free location to rise only until about 1 1/2 times its original size, about 1 hour (more in a cooler, dryer environment).",
            "Bake.",
            "As the dough is in its final rise, preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F.",
            "Once the dough has finished rising, uncover it, slash the top of each roll no more than 1/8-inch deep, brush the surface of each roll evenly with the egg wash, and place the baking sheet the center of the preheated oven.",
            "Bake for about 15 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown all over.",
            "Remove from the oven, and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling.",
            "Slice and serve when still slightly warm."
