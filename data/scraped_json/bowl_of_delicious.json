            "8 tablespoons butter (divided, preferably Irish salted butter, such as Kerrygold)",
            "3 large leeks (white and light green parts only, halved and sliced, washed thoroughly (see notes))",
            "2 - 2\u00bd pounds russet potatoes (about 3 medium potatoes, peeled and diced)",

            "Melt 6 tablespoons of the butter in a large pot over medium heat.",
            "Add the leeks, stir to coat in the butter. Cook for approximately 10 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally but not too frequently, until the leeks are meltingly tender and soft. You don't want them to brown- if they are browning, turn down the heat.",
            "While the leeks are cooking, peel and dice the potatoes (2 lbs.) into 1/2\" pieces. Tip: The smaller the pieces are diced, the shorter time the soup will take to cook.",
            "After the leeks are cooked, add the peeled and diced potatoes, chicken broth (4 cups), and some kosher salt and black pepper. Use more salt if you are using unsalted butter and/or low sodium chicken stock. Bring to a boil.",
            "Cover, turn the heat to low, and simmer for 10-15 more minutes, until potatoes are cooked through (use the tines of a fork to test the potatoes - if they pierce them very easily, the potatoes are done).",
            "Use an immersion blender to puree the soup directly in the pot. Alternatively, you can blend it in batches using a standing blender, or you can use a potato masher for a more rustic, lumpy texture.",
            "Turn off heat and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter until melted. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Tip: Don't be shy with the salt - this soup needs plenty of it!",
            "Serve topped with chopped fresh chives, cracked black pepper, crumbled bacon, and/or sour cream, if desired."
